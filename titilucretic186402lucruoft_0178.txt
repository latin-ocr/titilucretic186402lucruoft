portion one to another. In this sense therefore no conclusions can be
drawn from them about the equality proportions or differences of things,
and they that attempt to do it usually fall into paralogisms. So when
men argue against the infinite divisibility of magnitude by saying that
if an inch may be divided into an infinite number of parts, the sum of
those parts must be a foot 3 and therefore since all infinites are equal‚
those sums must be equal, that is, an inch equal to a foot, the falseness
of the conclusion shews an error in the premises: and the error lies 111
the position that all infinites are equal.' 623 Quod quoniam: comp. 221

all those cases is quod the relative or the conjunction, and if the former,
how does it differ thus used from the latter? from quod si for instance, if
this again be not the relative? Id quoque in 655 is quite different: it =

635—644: to maintain therefore with Heraclitus and his followers
that fire is the clement of all things is absurd.—Lucr. having now es-
tablished his two great principles of an unchangeable matter and a void,
before he proceeds at 921 to explain by them the nature of things, first
111 order to make their truth still more manifest, examines the elements
of Heraclitus Empedocles Anaxagoras and other philosophers and shews
their utter insufficiency. Of all these men he speaks with admiration
or tolerance, except Heraclitus whom he assails with a certain passion
and violence. Now that the star of the old Ephesian seems again in
the ascendant, such an attack will not meet with much sympathy3 the
motive however is plain enough: in him he is combating the stoics, the
bitter enemies of Epicurus, Heraclitus standing in the same relation to
them that Democritus stands to Epicurus. This will appear from the
fact that it is only from 690 to 704 that he addresses himself to Hera-
