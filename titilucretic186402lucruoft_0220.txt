wished, like other thinkers, to dei-ive his system from as few first princi-
ples as possible: he saw in mind his atoms descending from all eternity
in uniform blind motion. How then was existence possible? a sentient
first cause was to him inconceivable. This ‘minimum of declination then,
this perpaulum quo nihil posset 6836 minus, rose before his reason and
imaginatiom as the simplest theory which would solve the great problem
of being, of the creation of this and all other worlds with all that is in
them. What system-monger but somewhere or other reaches a point
where reason must be silent or sels-contradictoryl In a curious memoir
of the Berlin transactions for 1782 by G. L. Le Sage, called Lucrece
N eutonien, the author ingeniously argues that if Epicurus had had but
a part of the geometrical knowledge of say his contemporary Euclid, and
conceptions of cosmography the same as those of many then living, he
might have discovered the laws of universal gravity, and not only the
laws, but, what was the despair of N ewton , its mechanica] cause. Had
he supposed the earth to be spherica] and made his atoms move in di-
rections perpendicular to the surface of a sphere, that is towards its
centre, he might not only have proved the law of the inverse square of
the distance, but have demonstrated the cause of that law. But the
truth is Epicurus might probably have left his worlds to shift for them-
selves and let eternal time past take the place of a first cause, if he had
not wanted this theory mainly as we have said to explain the great mys-
tery of freewill: he wished to mark this as one of the cardinal points of
differ-enee between himself and Democritus whom Cicero praises for
choosing to accept fate and necessity rather than have recourse to such
a doctrine as this of Epicurus It is for this reason that Lucr. dwells
at such length and with such emphasis on this part of the question 3 out
of respect for Democritus as well as opposition to the stoics.

294—307: the matter of the whole universe never was either more
or less condensed than it is now: the motions which first-beginnings
now have, they always have had and will have: what they have pro-
duced, they will again produce: the sum of things 111 being no force can
change 3 for no new matter can escape out of the universe 1101· 601116 into
it and change the order of nature. 294 foll.: as his atoms are eternal,
it is an axiom that none can come into being or go out of being: the
sum of matter therefore must ever be the same. But perhaps the Qua·-
propter cet. of 297 18 not so self evident: as in any one part of the uni-
verse the motions etc. of atoms are constantly and necessarily changing,
one does not see that the sum of their motions throughout the universe
is the samej, yet this is what Epicurus and Lucr. affirm: but 866 11. to
