286 NOTEs 11

inser. de bacchanal. 19, and undecim unanimus unanimitas unoculus.
266 extremum, summum, penitus, in alto, the same thing in different
words to increase the force of the contrast : a very favourite artifice of
his.

269—323 (34¹7): the image is seen not at the surface of the mirror,
but beyond and within it in the same way that real objects are seen
through and beyond an open door, namely by two airs: it was explained
above 246 foll. how the distance of an object from the eye was perceived
by means of the air between it and the eye 3 thus you see first the dis-
tance of the open doorway by one air, then comes another air between
the doorway and the object outside, which lets you see how far it is be-
yond the door: thus too the mirror and its distance from us is seen by
means of its image which propels before it 1116 611 between the mirror
and the eye, which first sees this air, 111611 1116 11111101, 111611 when we
have perceived the latter, the image which goes from us 10 11, 6011166
back 10 116, 11111 drives onward an 611 which 16 66611 before the image,
and makes it appear 60 far distant beyond the mirror. Again our image

because on coming against the mirror it 16 dashed straight out in the
reverse direction, like a 1161 plaster-mask thrown 68611161 6 post. A gain

16666666 and turnings of a building. Again concave mirrors shew our
image with right answering 10 118111, left to left. Again the images
step and move 66 116 do, because when you withdraw from any part of
the 11111101, 11116866 66111101 601116 from that part of the mirror. 271
Quod yenus: 666 11. 10 11 194. vere: to me it appears marvellous that
Lach. should say ‘vere non modo supervacaneum est, sed caret sensu': it
clearly refers 10 1116 1661 objects seen by images coming from them di-
rectly in contrast 10 1116 111616 reflexions from a mirror, of yourself for
instance: 258 res ipsae perspiciantur. 271 and 278 transpiciuntur,
