τηρ γενομένη ἔοικε κάλλιον τῷ πατρὶ ἢ τῇ μητρὶ καὶ κοῦρος ’γενόμενος ἔστι
ὅτε κάλλιον ἔοικε τῇ μητρὶ ἢ τῷ πατρί. Lactant. de opif. dei 12 closely
copies Lucr. but strangely attributes the theory to Varro and Aristotle:
cum semina inter se permiaeta coalescunt, si virile superaverit, patri
similem provenire, seu marem seu feminam3 si muliebre praevaluerit,
proqeniem cuiusque sexus ad imaqinem respondere maternam. 1211
matrum, Ut patribus: Cic de fin. v 12 patri similis esse filiu8,· where
Madvig thinks patris to be perhaps right, as Cicero and the older
writers usually have a gen. of living things, especially men and gods,
while with inanimate things the gen. and dat. are employed promiscu-
ously: the dat. in later writers became almost universal: 1218 Lucr.
has similes avorum, 11 909 simili totis animalibus3 IV 1230 utri simi-
lest id, neut. but referring to a ]iving child: Madvig l. l. quotes oie. de
nat. deor. 11 149 plectri similem linquam nostri solent dicere, chorda·
rum dentes, nares cornibus iis qui cet. where, as in Lucr., both cases
are found together. 1213 vulta: Nonius p. 230 quotes this v. and
Ennius vestraque vulta. 1217 neque utrum i. e. neutrum: so v 839
uec utrum: neuter is only ne or nec uter, ne or uec, not non, being the
old negative: see n. to 111 199. 1220 Propterea cet.: Aristotle‚ who
discusses these very questions de gen. anim. 1v 3 p. 7 69 1 foll., finds
them all more difficult to answer than Luer. does: so l.1. 24 διαὶ τίν’
αἰτίαν εὀικὸς γίνεται τοῖς προγόνοις ὥς ἐπὶ τὸ πολι) καὶ τοῖς ἄποθεν; οὗ
γάρ ἀπ’ ἐκείνων γ’ ἀπελήλυθεν οὐθὲν τοῦ σπέρματος. 1225 (1227)·-
1228 (1226) must come in the order here given 3 sor surely voltus voces-
que comasque are comprehended in facies et corpora membraque 3 and if
they were not, what reason could there be for the poet's asserting that
they are as uncertain in their origin, as the body generally? just as if
any body were likely to think that the less essential were more unvary-
ing than the more essential: this indeed induced Lamb. to read minus
for maqis, Again, as Laeh. says himself, cle semine certo is here aut
virili aut muliebri, one not both ; and is opposed to 1229 duplici de
semine, and forms a contrast with it: 1225 (1227) indeed begins a new
question, which Arist. 1. 1. thinks it not easy to explain 3 why namely a
male child may be more like the mother, a female like the father.
1225 (1227) patrio i.e. as well as materno. 1226 (1228) Materno i. e.
as well as patrio. 1227 (1225) haec i. e. the distinctions of sex no
more come certo semine, from either the father's or the mother's alone,
than the form and features: Hippoer. 1.1. emphatically assei-ts the same:
thus 7 οὗτος ὁ λόγος αἱρέει καὶ τὸν ἄνδρα καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα ἔχειν καὶ θῆλυν
γόνον καὶ ἄρσενα, and 8 at end καὶ ταῦτά μοι καὶ τοσαῦτά ἐστι ἱστόρια τῷ
προτέρῳ λόγῳ, ὅτι ἔνεστι καὶ ἐν τῇ γυναικὶ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀνδρὶ καὶ κουρογονίη
καὶ θηλυγονίηε comp. this with Aristotle's doubts and difficulties.
1231 possis is potential: see n. to 1 327.
