Ἀ press better the poet’s meaning. 324 oio. de nat. deor. 11 142 acies ipsa
qua cernimus, quae pupula vocatur. contenta is well explained by 1v
802 and 809. 325 is rightly joined by Lamb. with what follows:
Lach. and Ed. in small ed. wrongly connected it with what precedes,
326 ‘mare quae inpendent: comp. Ter. Phorm. 180 tanta te inpendent
mala 3 Lucilius quae ‘res me inpendet, where Festus p. 161 9 says me is
‚for mihi. 1v 568 non auris incidit ipsas 3 where see note: so v 608 ac-
cidere has an accus. 326 vesco denotes the small fine particles of
spray 3 and a similar sense would suit every passage where the word
occurs3 as vescas frondes, vescum papaver in Virgil: see Conington to
georg. 111 175 3 and Ovid fasti 111 446 vescaque parva vocant, a decisive
authority. But Gellius XVI 5 6 perplexes the matter by deriving vescus
from ve and esca, and makes it signify in Lucr. ‘ eating much ', in Luci-

lius ‘eating little' ι then too it would be active here, passive in virgil,
if with him it meant ‘ edible '. Probably mere similarity of sound had
in Gellius’ time confused the meaning of the word, and it is curicus
that the passages in Virgil and Lucr. and perhaps some others favour
this ambiguity: Philargyrius too to georg. 111 175 says ‘Lucretius certe
pro edace posuit' 3 but Pliny nat. hist. vn 81 is as decisive for ‘ little' as
Ι ovid: corpore vesco, sed eximiis viribus: and Ovid and Pliny of course
far outweigh Gellius and Philargyrius. 327 possis-:precisely potest
„ of 324: it is, as often, merely potentia] ,· so 808 possint, 11 763 possis,
850 Quoad licet ac possis 3 where I now see Lach. to be wrong in read-
ing potis es: so 11 989 queant, v 210 si non cimus„ .nequeant; 7 68 si
,βιῶ-ρει, . ‚Cur nequeat, 11 922 Scilicet ut nequeant, where Lach. after
Bentl. reads nequeunt. 328 Corp. caec. see n. to 277. qerit res: the
metaphor is taken from the government of a state: res yeruntur, ¹qeri
res and the like occur frequently in Lucr. always more or less with the
same force: comp. Cic. de nat. deor. 11 82 where the stoic Balbus says
noe cum dicimus natura constare administrarique mundum.

329-369 : but there is void as well as body in things3 else there
could bc no motion, no birth, no growth: the hai-dest things can be pen-
etrated3 and therefore have void in them: again things of equal size
are not all of equal weight, only because one contains more or less void
than another. 329 the whole universe of things is not solid dense
body ; there is also void in things. corporea naturazcorpore, as animi
natura, ‘mundi natura etc.=animus, mundus etc. stipata a favourite
word to express what is close packed, pressed, rammed together : Wak.
well compares συμπιλεῖσθαι used in the same sense by Aristot. phys. 1v
9 near beg. 330 in rebus things in being, things formed, in contra-
distinction to the atoms: see n. to 419: Persius' parody 1 1 ο quantum
est in ‘rebus inane shews Lucretius’ expression was in vulgar use: comp.
piso PerS. 111 83 qiqni De nihilo nihil, in nihilum nil posse reverti.
