Meliboei’. 501 Thessalico conc. eoL: see n. to 1 474. tacta: Lucr-
uses continyo and contaetus in the same sense. Oudendorp to Lucan
x 491 among several false instances quotes Lucan 11 536 tetiqit sanquis
pollutos Caesaris enses. 502 ridenti: IV 1125 pulchra in pedibus
Sicyonia rident. 504 iacerent of course is continued to this verse:
Lucr. assumes according to wont that where the varieties are infinite
there must be infinitely good and infinitely bad in what they produce.
505 Lamb. seems to be right in taking Phoebea to imply tunes played
on the φόρμιγξ, the instrument of Phoebus. daedala chordis appears
to be the same as 412 per chordas orqam‘ci quae...fi9urant: both phrases
seem to imply the giving expression on the strings to all the varied
forms of the music: this v. even more than that consists of Greek
words, 509 in melioris depends in grammar on cede-re retro, in sense
on proqredi or the like. 513 and 518 summam i. e. the whole range
within which they move. 516 remensus is more than once passive in
Virgil. 517 Extima i. e. iacent. 520 mucroni: the metaphor
must be from the mucro or point of the stilus setting a mark at each
end of any length you wish to note: on the i of the abl. see n. to 1 978.
521-5682 the number of shapes being finite, the number of atoms
of each shape is infinite, since it was proved in the first book that the
sum of matter was infinite: if you say some animals are more scarce
than would be the case, if the atoms of which they were made were

, infinite, I answer these animals may be very numerous in remote

regions 3 but even if but one thing of its kind existed in the whole
world, this would imply an infinite sum of atoms3 else how could
these have met and united in the boundless ocean of matter: the first-
beginnin gs therefore os every shape and kind are infinite in number.
522 foll. see Epicurus cited to 478 foll. who precisely agrees with Lucr.
525 etenim cet. for no finite number multiplied by any finite number
however large can produce an infinite sum. And as Epicurus and
Lucr. conceived all infinites to be equal‚ the atoms of each shape must
to them have been equal to the sum of all the atoms of all shapes3 which
seems absurd 3 but this opinion they shared with all the ancients, and
moderns till comparatively recent times: Philoponus 1.1. to the last
section has a curicus argument to shew that Democritus holding the
atoms of each shape to be infinite must have held that there was τοῦ
ἀπείρου ἀπειρότερόν τι, and that the epicureans teaching that the num-
ber in each shape was infinite must have believed the same: this to him
seemed an absurdity3 and *it must have puzzled Epicurus and Lucr. as
well. Newton cited to 1 620 clears up the mystery. 525 cluere=essa
528 probavi 1 1008—1051: Lach. goes sadly astray‚ μέγας μεγαλωστί.
529 Versibus is thus nakedly put 1 416 Quam tibi de quavis una re
versibus cet. 530 Ε x infinito, i. e. tempore, not spatio, apparently:
