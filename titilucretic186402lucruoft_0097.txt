BOOK v 79

Ab J unt. first for A, rightly. 1258 in terra splendere Lach. first for in
terras. in terris Lamb. 1259 capti F lor. 31 Ver. Ven. for capiti. 1266
darent silvasque ut caedere possent Lach. for parent silvasque et cedere
possint. 1267 dolare et levia radere J unt. (Ald. 1 has ae for et) for dola-
ret levare ae radere.- which seems the simplest change. domo, levare ac
radere Lach. laevare dolare et radere Lamb. Lach. also suggests dolare
secare ac or dolare aequare ac. 1272 poterat Lamb. and Lach. for pote-
rant.- this I have received with some hesitation. 1273 Tum Lach. for
Nam. aes added by Flor. 31 Camb. etc. 1278 e added by Brix.

1285 flamma atque B corr. Flor. 31 Gamb. 4 Vat. for flammatque
iynes. flammae atque Nauger. Lamb. etc. 1294 obprobrium. obscenum
all the mss. of Macrob. sat. v1 1 63, collated by Ianus: a curious va-
riation. Lach. who depended on an old edition of Macrobius, is mis-
taken in supposing that obscenum is not the ms. reading. 1297 ar-
matum. reppertum Lamb. etc. and 1301 inventum J unt. Lamb. etc.
for armatum: both most needless changes 1300 biiuyos Faber for
biiuyo: biiuyo makes the construction extremely harsh, and, as Faber
says, has come from 1299. 1302 taetras (tetras) Lach. for tetros: rightly,
see 1339.

1310 partim. Parthi Camb. 2 Vat.: a reading adopted by Lamb.
Creech Wak. vulg. before Lach. 1311 doctoribus. ductoribus Ver. Ven.
Ald. 1 J unt. Nauger. Lamb. etc. 1315=11 632, except undique for
numine, seems clearly spurious and unmeaning. 1319 petebant Van. 640
Urbin. J unt. for patebant. 1320 deripiebant A Lach. diripiebant B
Nic. Nicc. Flor. 31 Camb. all before Lach. 1323 suos. sues Ver. Ven.
Avanc. Lamb. etc. 1325 fronte Lach. for mente which has 110 meaning.
ad terramque minanti mente Lamb. tacitly‚ Gis. Creech etc. and this
Marullus or Candidus doubtless meant to read. 1327 1328; Junt.
Lach. and. Ed. 111 small ed. omit the second3 Lamb. ed. l obelises the
first, ed. 2 and 3 both: ‘but see notes 2. 1330 dentis adactus J unt. for
dentis adauctus B, dentibus adauctus A Nic. Nice. Camb. dentibus
ictus Politian in marg. Flor. 29. 1340 fizta B corr. Lach. forfacto, most
rightly. 1341--1346 Lach. justly ejects the last three of these verses as
the work of an interpolat-013 but it is no less certain that the first three
are likewise spurious 3 Sifuit ut facerent is obviously a comment on Sed
faeere id non tam cet. Lach. to make sense and grammar is compelled
to read Sic fuit with Ald. 1 J unt. Lamb. for Si ficit, and to transpose
1342 and 1343: see Camb. J ourn. of phil. IV p. 288: 1345 = 528.

1351 tela paratur. tela parantur Lamb. perversely. 1368 terram
Lach. for terra. 1388 1389=1454 1455, and are here quite out of
place. 1391 tum haec sunt omnia ‘ut quidam legunt’ says Lamb. for
tum sunt omnia: comp. 1404. tum sunt earmina Lach. otia Faber.
1397 ioca Flor. 31 Ald. 1 Junt. for loca. 1400 monebat Flor. 31 J unt.
for movebat. 1405 solacia somni Lamb. Lach. for solacia somno: the
change seems necessary. ‘ secutus sum codicem Vaticanum’ says Lamb.
All the 11188. at present in the Vatican have, 1 believe, somno: but again
and again Lamb. speaks in the same vague way of Vatican and other
mss. 1409 servare recens Ed. for servare qenus: servare first absorbed
the re,· then cens became qenus. sonis Lach. Certainly yemis is quite
unmeaning. numeris Nic. Nicc. as wel] as Flor. 31. Ver. Ven. Avanc.
