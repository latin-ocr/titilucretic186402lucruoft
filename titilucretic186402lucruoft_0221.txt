though Lamb. objects to it. 301 Condicione: this spelling is now in·-
controvertibly fixed by reason and authority 3 cond. is related to condicere,
as dicio to dicere: the latter point is proved by Cicero himself de leg.
agrar. 11 39, where he puts together dicioni iudicio, and then clearly im-
plies that dicere is to dicio what iudicare is to iudicium: this at all
events settles the classical spelling. 303 Nee rerum summam cet: if
the Quapropter oet. is true, then this would be true: the sum of all
things in being, or of all worlds throughout the universe is ever the
same: this or that world may or must come into and go out of being;
but the whole sum will be the same. In fact it was a well-known
dogma of Epicurus that innumerable worlds were daily coming into
being and perishing ς but here again they seem to be forcing consequences
from the false premiss that all infinities are equal, the mother of so
many paralogisms. And is not this in contradiction with the acute
argument of 1 551 folM where in language almost identical with what
we have there quoted from Newton, he shews that the process of des-
truction is much more rapid than that of renovation. Well does not his
reasoning here assume the contrary‘l this world of ours for instance took
long ages to form 3 but, as he often repeats, it will some time or other
dissolve in a moment into its first-beginnings. When then throughout
the universe innumerable worlds are daily perishing and perishing in-
stantaneously‚ and every new world must take long ages to build up,
how can the sum of worlds remain constantCl on rerum summa see n. to

Epicurus in Diog. Laer. x 39 says more generally τὸ πᾶν ἀεὶ τοιοῦτον ἦν
οἷον νῦν ἐστὶ καὶ οἷεὶ τοιοῦτον ἔσται · οὐθὲν γάρ ἐστιν εἷς ὃ μεταβάλλει, παροὶ
γὰρ τό πᾶν οὐθέν ἐστιν ὃ ἂν εἶσελθόν εἰς αὐτὸ τήν μεταβολήν ποιήσαιτο.
308—332: though atoms are'in constant motion, yet the whole uni-
verse appears to be at rest, because they are far beneath the ken of our
senses: nay visible things often when seen from a distance seem to be at
rest 3 as a flock of sheep feeding3 or as an army of foot and horse, if
looked down upon from a height. 309 sint in motu: an unusual
rhythm 3 but in motu is to be taken metrically as one word 3 so always
inter se, inter nos and the like. 310 Summa . . summa: the play on
words which he so loves. 311 dat motu8=movetur3 see n. to 1 819:
either the sun or moon or the clouds or any thing moving on the earth
is an instance of such partial motion. 312 infra appears to be here
