formed this task2 he has not noted one reading in six 3 the most import-
ant variations he usually omits, and the readings he gives are as often
wrong as right. That which he has borrowed from others and tumbled
in a lump into his edition is for the most part as worthless as the scrib-
blings of a schoolboy. So incredibly careless is he, that the Vossian col-
lations which he borrows from Tonson are or should be those of 1115
Leyden mss: see note 1 130 v 471 for a glaring instance of a false reading
which he slavishly copies from Tonson and ascribes to his Leyden quarto.
N ay more the Bm of the London edition and his own X are one and the
same Bodleian 1115. 3 so that we have this ludicrous result, that the same
mss. are cited side by side 65 independent authorities His various
readings are therefore not only cumbrously inane, but are a snare and de-
lusion, and have led astray those who like Wakefield have trusted to them.
Thus in his hands the two unrivalled Leyden mss. have been worse than
useless. What he does himself is always worse done than what he bor-
rows from others, poor as that generally is: he has collated none of the
old editions except the Verona, and that was done for him, and better
done than he would have done it for himself. Nor are his explanatory
notes much better: he has heaped together in a crude mass those of the
chief editors 3 but except in the 0656 of Virgil and Horace and one or two
others of the best known poets, indexes to which are in everybody's
hands, he has not even supplied the references to Lambinus’ learned
notes who from the circumstances of his age could not himself furnish
them3 nay in one case he has given Lambinus' own words as those of
Cicero. In his two bulky volumes there is not one week’s genuine work
beyond what scissors and paste could do: seldom has perfomance fallen
so far short of profession and opportunity.

There is nothing to detain us between Havercamp and Wakefield
who in 1796 and 1797 gave his three volumes to the world, rivalling
the other’s in magnitude. Yet the work, such as it is, is his own, and is
not a mere slothful compilation from others. Gilbert Wakefield pos-
sessed one quality which a critic can ill dispense with, that of despising
any amount of authority which did not rest on some real foundation,
and refusing to admit that, because a reading had appeared in edition
after edition for centuries, it might by that alone claim recognition. He
therefore set about a new revision which was 130 be based on manuscript
authority alone3 but neither his knowledge nor his industry nor his
ability nor his taste sufficed for such a work. He professed to collate
five English mss, among them our Cambridge one, and most of the old
editions. This task he executed with incredible carelessness. As he
had the full use of the Cambridge 1115, 0116 might have expected that his
collation of it would be done with some care,- but it is quite untrust-
worthy. From this as well as the evidence of his own notes and the
nature of the case I infer that his other collations are not more to be
depended upon. Had this labour been faithfully performed, it would
still have been of little use, as he had no notion of the true relation of
these late mss. to one another. He looked 011 66011 65 611 independent
authority and thought he could not do wrong, if the words he put in his
text were found in one or other of them. Then he had to take from
Havercamp the readings of the Leyden mss„ and therefore could gain no
