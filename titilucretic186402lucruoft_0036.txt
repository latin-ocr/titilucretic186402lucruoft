20 NOTES I

and some others have in various journals and publications made much
ado about a codex Victorianus as they call it, once belonging to P. Vic-
torius, now in the Munich library, as if it were a rival, or nearly so, of
A and Β. From the readings cited Ι· 866 clearly that it is a common
Italian fifteenth century ms. neither better nor worse than twenty
others, much resembling the Verona and Venice editions and of no
importance whatever. It will be seen that by the materials which I
have collected and just described I have 111 many important cases got
nearer than has been done before to the readings of Poggio’s ms. which
was a worthy rival of the Leyden two.

But Lachmann's long experience and disciplined acuteness have
enabled him to go beyond existing mss. and to tell us much ,of the lost
original or archetype, as I call it after him, of all existing mss. Notes 1
will shew that many difficulties are cleared up by this knowledge.
This archetype then, though it is not certain that even A was imme-
diately taken from it, was written in thin capitals, like the medicean
of Virgi13 the words were not separated, but in the middle of verses
points were put at the end of clauses Ancient mss. as a rule keep
with singular care to the same number of lines in a page: ours had 26
lines in a page, excepting only those which concluded a book. But
remember there was a heading or title at the beginning of each section 3
and each of these headings occupied a line. Lachmann brings many
proofs of this being the number. When this ms. was copied, it was
clearly much torn and mutilated. It was stated above that four
portions, omitted in their place by B, come together at the end, and
that these each formed a leaf of the archetype which had fallen out of
its place and been put at the end. Each of these alone or with its
headings consists of 52 lines. Then turn to note 1 to 1v 299—347
(323-7-347 299—322) where this inversion is explained in the same
way, by the accident that is of a loose leaf being turned the wrong
way: see also note 1 to Ι 1068-1075 and 1094—1101‚ where the
mutilationis accounted for in the same manner. Thus we obtain six
certain landmarks in different parts of the poem. The archetype there-
fore consisted of 300 pages, or admitting, as seems to be an undoubted
fact, that a whole leaf 18 lost between v1 839 and 840, of 3023 of
which the first and last were not written upon, as well as one for some
reason or other between 1 785, which ends one of the loose leaves at the
end of Β, and 1068 which, as shewn in note l, begins a fresh leaf.
Page 190 which followed the end of IV was left blank. I may also note
that p. 137 and 191 contained an index of the headings of IV and v
respectively, although the different titles come in their places in these
books too, as well as in the others which have no such index prefixed.
Having made for myself a list of these pages after the rules stated in
various places by Lachmann, I have found it of great use 3 as the ends
of lines throughout the book towards the bottom of the several right· ’
hand pages had been specially exposed to mutilation in the damaged
archetype. Verses also omitted in their proper places were apt in this
as in other mss. to be put afterwards at the bottom of pages. Besides
the injuries which it had received from accident 01· ill usage, our

archetype must in many respects have been very carelessly written,
