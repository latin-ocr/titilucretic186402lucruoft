unlike what Cicero Tusc. disp. Ι 41 uses: alter [Aristoxenus] ita delec-

have taught him better on this head, though he were a better teacher of

celebrated dialogue Eudemus where this theory was discussed and re-

we see the anima sympathise throughout the frame with the animus:

the anima therefore is united with the animus, and being moved by it, Ι

stirs the whole body. 136 coniuncta, the neut.''as usual when referred
