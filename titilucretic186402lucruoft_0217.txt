to Ἡ 57 4 illustrates this use of pondera for the equilibrium of a thing,
from Ovid met. 1 13 pendebat in aere tellus Ponderibus librata suis, and
Lucan 1 57 librati pondera caeli 3 but Turnebus and 116 are quite wrong
in asserting that pondus is not so used in the sing. ε 366 my note there.
ferme: see 11. 10 1 l4fi3rae. 219 Ine. loci sp. is repeated 260 and 293

ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, appears 3 certain correction. paulum, Tantum quod
momen mutatum d. p. is well expressed by Cic. l. 1. perpaulum quo nihil

in Cicero, but 116 seems to use it of time, tantum quod. .‚ cum cet. mo-

see n. to 1 327. 223 Nee cet. as expl. in what follows. The atoms
would have gone on for all eternity to descend in parallel lines with equal
velocities. Lucr. does not tell us whether every atom thus swerved
at some time or other 3 nor whether an atom could thus swerve only once 3
and Cicero seems not to know what Epicurus taught on this point.
225—250: you must not think that the heavier can overtake the
lighter atoms and so give birth to things: 3 heavier thing falls more
quickly than a lighter through water or air, because these offer unequal
resistance to unequal weights: 1101 30 with void which yields to light
and 116311)Τ alike: nothing therefore can account for the first collision of
atoms except this declination 3 which must be the least possible, that we
may not attribute to them oblique motions. 225 potesse: see n. to 1
665. 228 reddere in Lucr. often means simply dare or edere 3 and so
I have understood it here, though it is possible the sense may be ‘render
the motions begetting‘: but comp. 890 vitalem reddere sensum, which
seems quite parallel. 232 tenuis seems to be 3 110111111. 33 1 281 mol-
