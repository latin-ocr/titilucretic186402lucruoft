particles streaming from it cause a void between it and the 11011, these
particles in a united mass fill thevoid, and as the particles of iron 316
very closely packed, the whole ring must follow, when a certain number
have thus advanced: this takes place on all sides, as particles stream
from the magnet all round, if not by their own motion, yet by impact:
as there is a void too on one side of the iron, the air on the other sides
helps to push it on as well as the air in motion within the ring. 998
confirmata, locata, praeposta, parata, a curious agglomeration of parti-
ciples, though praeposta seems to have almost the force of a subst.
‘points laid down beforehand'. 1007 utque ends 1 755. 1009
primoribus = primis: 866 Foro. 1011 horror: 11 410 serrae stridentis
acerbum horrorem: horror in these two places :quod facit horrorem.
1012 ibus: 11 88 a teryo ibus obstet: here, as there, the obsolete sorni
has occasioned a corruption: ex elem. depends of course on corpora,
c fhrro on coorta; though Lucr. does not avoid two prepositions in 13116
831116 clause: 1v 694 Ex alto primum quia vix emittitur ex re: see n. to
1 412. 1016 compaqibas : 1071 Quam laxare queant compaqes taurea
vincla. 1017 undecumque appears here 130 have the sense of abicam-
qae. 1020 nec ipsa cet. 1.6. 113111 ipsa quidem sponte sua non possunt.
1022 quare—iuvatur: Lucr. 18 fond of parenthetical clauses like this:
comp. 111 1068, 790 and v 134, in 311 which passages, as here, the text
is made clear by this simple method without any change whatever.
1023 adiumento implies something which adds 1138 assistance to the
forces of the thing itself. 1022 Huc accedit, 1024 Quod, followed
by an indic. as always. 1027 propellat: 1v 195 a terqo quae provehat
atque propellat, perhaps the only examples of this quantity: 1029 pro-
pellat, as elsewhere. 1032 Parvae here appears to be emphatical, ⁴ to
the very smallest parts'. 1036 rebus circumd.: 1 87 circumdata comp-
tus, 3 different constr. ε 866 11. 130 1 38. adpositus: Sen. nat. quaest. Π 6
aer continuus terrae est et sic adpositus ut statim ibi futurus sit unde
illa discesserit. 1040 quo cet. 3 relative clause coupled with et partem
in vacuam, as 80 often in Lucr.: comp. 1015 Quod facit, et sequitur, 11
140, and some of the examples in n. to 1 718. 1041 con. sum: 326
maynum conamen sumit eundi.

1042—1064: but if brass come between the magnet and the iron,
then the iron is repelled, not attracted 5 because the stream of particles
from the brass first fills the pores of the 11011, those from the magnet
follow, and finding the 11011 already occupied, beat on it and repel it:
other things are not thus repelled like iron for various reasons : gold is
too heavy, wood too porous, iron is the due mean. 1044 Samothracia
seem to be mentioned by Pliny xxxm 23, 3 1110813 obscure passage:
Isidor. orig. xlx 32 5 says that the Samothracian ring is aureus quidem,
sed capitulo ferreo: whether this is meant by Lucr. I cannot say.
