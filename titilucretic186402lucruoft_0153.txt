him: see introduction p. 108. 18¹7 probably he meant the rhythm to be
an echo of the sense. arbusta: as arbores cannot come into the verse,
Lucr. always uses for it arbusta in the nom. and acc. ε but as arboribus
is suitable enough and often used, in the only instance of arbustis V 1378
the word has apparently its ordinary meaning of plantations of trees.
188 quando in the sense of quoniam or quandoquidem and always
governing an indic. is common in Lucr. and the older writers: Madv.
de fin. p. 649 allows it also in Cicero: it occurs below in 206. 191
yrandescere used twice again by Lucr. and by Cic. Arat. prognost. fragm. 5.

192 Huc accedit uti, a prosaic but very common phrase in Lucr.:
also Ιι. ac. item quod. 197 110 several times repeats this comparison
of the elements of words with the elements of thingS, led to it doubtless
by the common name. It is a favourite and natural artifice of his to
give colour to his arguments on abstruse matters by illustrations from
things visible or intelligible to all z to this we shall often have occasion

them. 202 perhaps one of the 3 cases where saecla in Lucr. has its
ordinary sense 3 the other two being 111 948 and 1090: see n. to 20
saecla z so that vit. saecla here means the number of years over which a
life, probably a human life, extends : comp. Virgil’s imitation in georg.
11 295 Multa virum volvens durando saecula vincit3 and Aen. xl 160
vivendo vici mea fata: in all these cases the alliteration has influenced
the phrase. 20¹7 Aeris. . auras and aeriae aurae are very favourite
pleonasms for aer in Lucr. teneras: 11 146 Aera per tenerum: the air

'has the same epithet in Ennius Virgil and Ovid: it implies what is

80113 yielding elastic: comp. Ov. trist. 111 8 7 tenera nostri-s· cedente vola-
tibus aura and Cic. de or. 111 176 nihil est enim tam tenerum neque tam
flexibile ‘neque quod tam facile sequatur quocumque ducas, quam oratio,
where it has the same force, · as also orator 52 : de nat. deor. 11 65 he
translates by aethera, Qui tenero terram circumiectu amplectitur the
αἰθέρα, καὶ γῆν πέριξ ἔχονθ’ ὑγραῖς ἐν ἀγκάλαις of ΕΠ11Ρ1ᾶο8.209 man-

ct qrandiores cdere (ayer) : reddere 18 regularly used in this sense. fetas
with one exception always in Lucr. means the produce of the earth or
trees. 210 videlicet has here the construction of videre licet: so 11
469 Scilicet 03εο 9ἰοόοεαι Forc. will give other instances from other
authors s. vv.: on the other hand Lucr. 11 809 Scire licet. . putandum est,
gives scire licet the constr. of scilicet. 211 212 repeated with slight
change V 210 211. cimus only occurs in these two places, ciere being
the com. form : 111 303 percit 3 vl 410 concit. 213 214 if there were
