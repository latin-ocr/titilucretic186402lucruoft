copying him: thus 1201 expresses Thuc. l. l. οἶ πολλοὶ ὕστερον δι’ αὐτήν
ἀσθενείᾳ ἁπεφθείροντοε 1205 foll. he again takes him up, καὶ εἴ τις ἐκ τῶν
μεγίστων περιγένοιτο κ.τ.λ.; what comes between the words just quoted
is as follows, διεξῄει γὰρ δισῖ παντὸς τοῦ σώματος ἅνωθεν ἀρξάμενον τὸ ἐν τῇ
κεφαλῇ πρῶτον ἱδρυθὲν κακόν, the disease took its course through the
whole body beginning in the head: is it not 1311611 probable that the
poet, having a corrupt copy or an imperfect recollection of his author,
has misapprehended his meaning, confounding τό ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ κακόν
with capitis dolor, and making the whole substance of the body run
into the head instead of letting the disease pass from the head through
the whole body. 1203 sanquis: 866 1v 1050. 1204 Huc, ‘in alvum
aut nares' Lach.: I believe it refers only 130 nares: besides Thuc. says
nothing at all here of the nares, nor is it easy 130 866 why Lucr. should
do 80 except from misapprehending Thuc. in the way suggested above.
1205 Profl. exierat, 1217 exciret odorem: see n. to v 1330 exibant
adactus. 1209 fhrro prin: the words of Thuc. which Lucr. repre·
8611138 in 1206—1211 are these, τῶν γε ἀκρωτηρίων οἷντίληψις αὐτοῦ ε’πεσή-
μαινε· κατέσκηπτε γσῖρ ἐς αἰδοῖα καὶ ἐς ἄκρας χεῖρας καὶ πόδας, καὶ πολλοὶ
στερισκόμενοι τούτων διέφευγον, εἶσὶ δ’ οἳ καὶ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶνι the disease
passed through the body from the head downwards ἐς τήν κοιλίαν, and if
a man was not killed by the terriblc ulceration and diarrhoea, it fastened
on the extremitieS, the toes fingers genitals 3 and some escaped with the
loss of these, στερισκόμενοι τούτων, or of the eyes: Lucr. however has
understood στερισκόμενοι to mean ferro privati, and this has given an
awkward turn to his whole sentence: this misapprehension was pointed
01113 centuries 380 by Victorius var. lect. XXXV 8, and in the letter
above referred to, and seems to have brought upon him no small obloquy,
from Lamb. and his correspondent Mercurialis among others: in those
days, while everybody had ostentatiously 130 protest against the religion
of Lucr.‚ it seems to have been deemed an impertinence to question his
knowledge of Greek or his clinical and 81118103] skill. 1211 tamen,
quamvis sine manibus cet. 1212 Usque adeo mortis cet: he takes
advantage of his own error to point his favourite moral. incesserat is of
course from incedo, not incesso. 1213 1214 are a very literal trans-
lation of Thuc. τούς δὲ καὶ λήθη ἐλάμβανε παραυτίκα ἀναστάντας τῶν πάντων
ὁμοίως, καὶ η’γνόησαν σφᾶς τε αὐτοῦς καὶ τούς ἐπιτηδείους, with 13116 omission
however of παραυτίκα ἀναστάντας, which seem of importance in the ac-
count: see the commentators of Thuc. rer. cunct. neque 0613. 1. 6. 613
