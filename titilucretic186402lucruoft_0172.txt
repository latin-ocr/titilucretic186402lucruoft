he formed them3 and that these primitive particles being solids are in-
comparably harder than any porous bodies compounded of them, even so
very hard as never to wear or break in pieces.' Farther on he speaks
of ‘ particles of matter of several sizes and figures and in several propor-
tions to space, and perhaps of different den-sities andsorces.’ His particles
agree in every point with those of Lucr. except in the concluding words.
It appears from a most interesting discussion in Edleston's correspon-
dence of N ewton and Ootes p. 75 foll. that Cotes objected to one of the
corollaries of his principia, unless he altered the last clause just quoted
from his optics. Upon which Newton thanks him for explaining his
objection and adds a fourth corollary, Si omnes omnium corporum parti-
culae solidae sint eiusdem densitatis neque absque poris rarefieri possint,
vacuum datur, thus coming to a complete agreement with Lucr.
551—576 ε if these first bodies did not set a limit to the division of
things, nothing could come into being 3 for as things are destroyed more
quickly than renewed, infinite time to come could not restore what in-
finite time past had gone on breaking up: again with solid first bodies
the existence of soft things can be explained by help of void : with soft
first bodies the existence of hard things cannot be understood. 553
redacta used absolutely without in or ad or some other prepos. is very
rare: comp. Ter. heaut. 945 eius animum . . retundam, rediyam, ut quo

frenat viribus auctum and v 846. perv. ad or in ‘ to arrive at’: so Cicero
pervadere in Italiam, in aures aud the like3 but pervadere animos ‘ to
pervade the minds’ 3 and so Varro de ling. Lat. vn 14, cited by Lach.

pervade polum valet vade per polum. 55¹7 foll. an acute argument
which may perhaps help to confute another of his theories in 11. Comp.
also the passage quoted from Newton in the next section. 55'7 the

double one, quod Zonya diei aetaS, [hoc est] infinita aetas ant. temp.:

conjectures here lonya dies et: comp. too Enn. ann. 401 lonqinqua dies

is always 4 syll. in Lucr. and the older writers, who refused to unite the
last two syll.: the first is only lengthened by metrical necessity, as it is
short in metres which admit that quantity, and was never lengthened
after it became a trisyll. Many, Virgil Horace etc„ avoid the word z see
Lach. p. 305 : if Manil. 11 734 be not admitted, Persius Silius Statius
Juvenal first used it as a trisyll.: comp. v 679 Conseque', the principle of
