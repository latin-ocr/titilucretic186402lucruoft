corde meo, 55 Teque, pater Tiberine, tuo eum flumine sancto: Virg. fol-
lows with suo tristi eum eorde, tuo perfusi flumine sacro, suo cum qur-
9ite flavo. 39¹7 the constr. seems to resemble some of the instances
given in n. to 1 15: the Extantis...monti8 is joined by attraction with
inter quos because it is nearest: if the inter quoe preceded the montis
there would be nothing harsh or unusual in the constr. 3 but the Extan-
τῖε cet. is put first to give it emphasis. 404 iubar i.e. solis: v 697
tremulum iubar haesitat iqnis. 409 Festus p. 375 veruta pila dieun-
tur quod. . habeant praefixa [Paulus supplies quod veluti verua habent
praefixa] Ennius li. x cursus quingentos saepe veruti. Virgil and Ti-
bullus have the form veru, and Virg. the adj. verutus.

414 At conlectus, 436 At maris, 447 Ac si: at here=denique3 as
also 998 At consueta, 1007 Ab variae3 1165, 1168, V 650, 1028, 1361,
1379, 1436: this use of at in transitions is common enough in Cicero:
see Mayor’s ed. of Halm phil. 11 7. conlectus aquae: 111 198 lapidum
conlectum: Fore. and Lach. cite for the word Frontinus si collectus plu-
vialis aquae cet. diyitum ‘non alcior unumt. Madvig Lat. gram. 305
and 306 illustrates at length this omission of quam: very similar is
Livy xxt 61 10, which 116 quotes, raro umquam nix minus quattuor pedes
alta iacuitJ, but the law is usually restricted to plus minus amplius
maior minor: Virg. ecl. 111 105 Tris pateat caeli spatium ‘non amplius
ulnas. 416 417 Il. Θ 16 and Hes. theog. 720 had made this notion
familiar to poets, though perhaps Virg. geor. 11 291 and Aen. vl 577
was also thinking of Lucu, despectum. . patet suggesting patet . . sus·
pectus. 416 inpete here is simply size‚ which seems to be derived
from the primary meaning of force and vehemence: so V 200 quantum
caeli teyz‘t impetus inqens, for there seems no allusion there to a revolving
heaven3 and VI 186 Extruetis aliis alias super impete miro: v 913
tanto membrorum esse impete natum seems to express both force and
size: Caes. de bel. Gall. 111 8 in mayno impetu marie acque aperto, com-

pared with 9 7 in vastissimo atque apertissimo oceano and 12 5 vasto
atque aperto mari, extent seems to be the chief notion expressed. 417 j
caeli . . hiatu-5², perhaps with reference to Ennius' caeli palatum aster the ²
Greek. 419 mirando, because it is wondrous strange that heaven A*
should be there in that small puddle: 462 Cetera de yenere hoc mirando ς
vl 692 mirando pondere saxa, v 1171 mirando corporis auctu. See J
notes l, and notes 1 and 2 to 1v 213. Shelley in the recollection beau·
tifully enlarges on this theme which would naturally impress itself on ’ἕ
the mind of a poet: We paused beside tlte pools that lie Under the forest v

bouyh: Eaelc seemed as &were a little sky &affeci in α world below 3 A fir-

mament of purple liyht, Which in the dark emh, lay...In which, the
