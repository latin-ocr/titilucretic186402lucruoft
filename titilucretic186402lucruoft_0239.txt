vour: these qualities are all frail and mortal, and must therefore be
wanting to immortal elements unless things are to pass away to nothing.
842 colore: the frequency with which this word has been repeated in
the last 100 111108 18 very striking. 842 foll. notice the variety of ex-
pression to denote privation : spoliata secreta sterila ieiuna seiuncta, and
above privata, sine odore, sonitu remota, orba colore, efflare stinyui eva-

manerezesse, 845 feruntur=sunt, as cluent so often does in Lucr.: it is
curious that two such opposite words should come to have the same
force: fhruntur is elsewhere applied by him to his atoms in motion 3 but
that can hardly be its sense here: with manere comp. 1110 1180 of stare in

vaporem, the epithets are distinctive. 845 sonitu sterila: the gen. is
more common: the form sterilus is mentioned by Festus: comp. in
Lucr. hilaro and sublima. suco ieiuna: Cic. orator 106 has the gen.

the mixture with 011. 849 nardi florem, unless Lucr. is speaking
vaguely, must be used, as Bacchi flos and the like, for the aroma or bou-
