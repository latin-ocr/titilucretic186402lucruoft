clitus, from 645 to 689 it is always ‘ they’: faciant, cernunt, amittunt
etc. Indeed 643 644 seem to shew, as we might expect, that 116 was
not insensible to that style and those sayings which sound so grandly
even now in the few fragments that have survived. One in the position
of Lucr. could only 666 611(1 criticise a rival philosopher from his own
point of view: even Aristotle is taxed with thus dealing with Heraclitus.
The πῦρ ἀείζωον φρόνιμον, 13116 πάντα οἰακίζων κεραυνός, the iynis sincerus
et sine ullius materiae permixtione, ut putat Heraclitus, would seem to
Lucr. a mere outrage on nature and reason 3 and therefore he will have
the heraclitean and stoical fire to be his own fire. 635 Quapropter
has clear reference to what just precedes: simple fire as an clement
cannot have the properties which birth-giving matter must have, coueaeus,
pondera etc.: this word alone would refute the monstrous corruptions, ‘ni
and multis, which Lamb. and all Subsequent editors introduce in 628 611(1
631. 638 dux has the double meaning of leader in war, and chief of
a sect: Hor. epist. 1 1 13 quo me duce, quo lare tuter 3 Quintil. inst. V 13

quaesitum. 639 Clarus ε 6 play on its double meaning, as 475 Clara

ver.: Ter. heaut. 372 has inversa verba, where the meaning is as uncertain
as here: Quintil. inst. v111 6 44 ἀλληγορία, quam inversionem iuterpre-
tantur, aliud verbis aliud seusu ostendit, etiam iuterim contrarium 3 and
this sense admirably suits the extant fragments of Heraclitus. Cic. de
orat. 11 261 uses immutata oratio with this meaning, inversio verborum
“ with that of our irony. The expression might apply equally well to
words in a forced and unnatural position, and therefore obscure.
644 fucata sonore seems 6 very bold metaphor.

645-—689 ε how could simple fire produce such a variety of things?
itis of no use to condense or rarefy fire, if it always remains fire: nay
they deny void without which even this condensing and rarefying is
impossible. But if they say the fire is extinguished in the process, they
make things come from nothing. The truth is there are certain first
bodies which are not like fire nor any thing in being, but which produce
fire and all other things alike by their varied shapes motions arrange-
ments collisions. 645 foll. Heracl. frag. 41 Sehl. πυρὸς οἷνταμείβεται
