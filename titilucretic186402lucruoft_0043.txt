pursued by Lachmann. The same system too he has carried out in
those volumes of the elaborate edition of Cicero edited by him and
Baiter, which came out after Lachmann's Lucretius. Stimulated by
the examples of Madvig Ritschl and Lachmann the rising generation of
German scholars has pursued the critical study of Latin with eminent
success 3 and nearly all of them follow in orthography the guidance of
Lachmann. This system then may fairly Ι think be now regarded as
the true ‘ conventional' system 3 for surely the school of Lachmann and
Ritschl in the nineteenth century has a better right to dictate to us in
the present day what shall be accepted as ‘conventional' than the
Poggios and Vallas of the fifteenth. Ribbeck in his Virgil shews him-
self a most devoted pupil of Lachmann, and generally he takes the right
direction 3 though some defect of taste and judgment makes him not
unfrequently misuse his glorious opportunities and push the matter to
the verge of caricature.

In following Lachmann then Ι am sure that Ι have authority on my
side 3 Ι believe that I have reason as well. In those cases indeed to
which Ι have already alluded, where the universal testimony of inscrip-
tions and of mss. beyond a certain age prove that there is only one
right way and about which the best scholars are all now agreed, there
cannot be any doubt what course should be taken: we must write
querella loquella luella sollers sollemnis sollicito Iuppiter littera quattuor
stuppa lammina bracchium,· on the other hand milia conecto coneaeus
conici conioeus coniveo conubium belua baca sucus litus and the like 3
condicio solacium, setius artus (adj.) autumnus suboles: in many of them
an important principle is involved: obeying the almost unanimous tes-
timony of our own and other good mss. we cannot but give umerus
umor and the like3 also hiemps. I have heard it asked what then is
the genitive of hiemps: to which the best reply perhaps would be what
is the perfect of sumo or supine of emo. The Latins wrote hiemps, as
they wrote emplum sumpsi sumptum and a hundred such forms, because
they disliked m and s or t to come together without the intervention of
a p sound 3 and our mss. all attest this: tempto likewise is the only true
form, which the Itali-ans in the l5th century replaced by tento. Then
mss. and inscriptions prove that cl took an n before it, tandem quendam
eundem and the like, with the sole exception of circumdo in which the mss.
both of Lucr. and Virgil always retain the m: and generally, though not
invariably‚ m on the other hand* remained before q: quemquam tam-
quam and so on. T hen always quicque quicquam quicquid (indefi), but
generally quidquid (relative) 3 always peremo interemo etc. etc. Above all
we must scout such barbarisms as coelum moestus sylva caetera nequicquam.
In these points Wagner is as good a guide as Lachmann; but in regard
to the cases in which ancient usage varied shall we follow the former
who deserts the mss. for preconceived general rules‚ or Lachmann who
here also is content to obey the best evidence he can get'l Ι have unhesi-
tatingly come over to the views of the latter: ‘hypotheses non fingo'
should be the rule in this as in other matters. As said above, all these
uncertain spellings fall under a very few general heads. One of these
is the assimilation or non-assimilation of prepositions: inpero repre-
sent-s the etymology, impero the pronunciation of the word. From the
