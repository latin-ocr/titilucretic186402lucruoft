his poem with this description which is an imitation, in ‘many parts a
close translation, of Thucydides 11 47—54. One would infer from the
words of Lucr. that he had no practica] or scientific knowledge of any
such like form of disease: he is content to take on trust whatever the
historiari says and, as we shall see, more than once misapprehends or
misinterprets his words. I have looked into many professional accounts
of this famous plague: the writers almost without exception praise Thu-
cydides' accuracy and precision, and yet differ most strangely in the
conclusions they draw from his words: I can name physicians, English
French and German, who after examining the symptoms have decided
that it was each of the following maladies, typhus scarlet putrid yellow
camp hospital jail sever, scarlatina maligna, the black death, erysipelas,
smallpox‚ the oriental plague, some wholly extinct form of disease: each
succeeding writer succeeds at least in throwing doubts on his predeces-
sors' diagnosis. Lucretius' copy must manifestly be even more vague
and inconclusive. The truth is that having laid down his general prin-
ciples of disease and vindicated his philosophy, he seeks now to satisfy
his poetical feeling by a powerful and pathetical description which he
has plainly left in an unfinished state. He has been imitated in turn
by virgil geor. ΠΙ 478-566, closely by Ovid met. VII 523-613‚ by
Livy more than once, and by others.

1138 mortifer aestus has no reference Ι think to Ilaec: Haec ratio
is the law of diseases just mentioned, which at this time caused a mor-
tifer aestus ; so that Lachmann’s obj ection ‘quis enim has res diversissi-
mas coniungat, haec ratio et mortifer aestus morborum' has no force.
The first words of Virgil's description Hic quondam ‘morbo are evidently
suggested by Lucr. and it is not unlikely that the aestu of 479, used in
a different sense, is a reminiscence of our aestus 3 and it is nearly certain
that Ovid 1.1. 529 et iyuavos inclusit ‘nubibus aestus comes from Lucr.
when we recollect the mode in which he makes pestilence approach,

1139 fun. red. i. e. funestavit, morte polluit: Virgil 1.1. 481 Corrupicque
lacus, infecit pabula tabo, the rhythm is evidently modelled on Lucr. as
