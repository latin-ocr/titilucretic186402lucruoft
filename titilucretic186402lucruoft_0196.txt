which I have made of 984 (998)—987 (1001) will I believe make his
argument quite clear: he is going to shew that space is infinite and
matter infinite: the former he proves 988 (984)—1007, the latter 1008

section that the universe or omne or τό πᾶν 16 infinite. There can of
course properly speaking be no proof of this, as Lucr. has wisely seen:
it must from the nature 01 the case be shewn by a series of identical
propositions‚ call them as you plcase definitions postulates or axioms:

rightly interpreted. 958 quod est is added to Omne, as in 523: so 969
