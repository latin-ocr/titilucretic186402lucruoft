29 moenera: this antique form Lucr. uses three times, as well as
moerorum twice, and poeniceus and poenibat: see also n. to 11 830 poe·
niceus. militiai: Lucr employs this old form of the gen. very often in
the case of substantives, more rarely in that of adjectives: a dat. in -ai
is quite unknown to him. 34 Reicic or reiecit, never reiicit 3 and so
of the other compounds of iacio: these are the only spellings known in the
best ages aec. dev. vuln. am.: Virg. Aen. vul 394 varies the phrase:
aeterno fatur devinctus amore. vulnus and cognate metaphors are fre-
quently applied to love in bk. 1v. 35 ter. cer. rep. Cic. Arat. frag.
vlu before him has tereti cervice refleaeum of Draco's head : Aen. v111 633

rotundatum '‚ and Servius more than once gives a similar explanation.
Right, if a cylinder or pole be in question: 80 teretes trunci and teres
oliva in Virgil. It is connected with tero and similar Greek words, and
seems to denote that the thing with which it is joined is of the proper
shape, neither too thick nor too thin. Thus a teres cervia) is a neck that
has the true outline of beauty, neither lean nor fleshy, neither too long
nor too short. So brachiolum teres in Catullus, teretes surae and teres puer
in Horace. Appul. florid. 11 15 p. 51 says of a beautiful statue cervia· suci
plena, malae uberes, yenae teretes, where the epithets are pretty nearly
synonymous: comp. too 1v 58 the teretis tunicas and v 803 B’olliculos
teretis of the cicada, i. e. coats of equal and regular thinness and. fineness
all over. Hence metaphorically aures teretes 111 Lucr. and Cic. oratio teres
in Cic. ore teres in Persius, teres atque rotundus 111 Horace. 36 Pascit,
avidos, inhians: the simple directness of these terms has a singular
force: comp. Tasso Ger. lib. xv1 19 Ε i famelici squardi avidamente In
lei pascendo. Spenser is full of imitations, such as this Lony fed his
yreedy eyes with the faire siylit. pascere oeulos is a common phrase:
