22 NOTES Ι

Some readers may be surprised at the number of verses which have
been transposed in the poem3 but they should remember that every
ancient writing which depends finally on one ms. is in a similar plight.
WVhen a scribe omitted by accident a verse, in order not to spoil the
look of his book, he wrote it at once after the next verse, if he immedi-
ately discovered his error 3 if not, he omitted it altogether, or added it
in some other place, often at the bottom of a page 3 he would then affix
an a, b to mark the right order 3 the next scribe would not notice or
would purposely omit these and so on : see Bentl. to Hor. ars-46. Every
one of these errors has been committed again and again by the copyists
of our poems. Most of these transpositions are certain aud were made
long ago by Lambinus Marullus Avancius and others3 many were first
made by Lachmann. Some of these I have not followed: not a few
I have first ventured on myself. But connected with this question I
must draw attention to one point which seems of importance. You
would expect as a rule single verses to be thus transposed, and this is
the case in Lucretius' mss. as in those of other writers: sometimes too
one or more verses are repeated after the misplaced v. which ought to
follow it in its proper place as if to shew the reader whither it ought to
be transferred: comp. 1v 991 i. e. 999 of the mss. followed in them by
1000—1003, which are only the vss. which follow it in its right place
repeated aster it in its wrong place: see also v 570 (573) and what comes
after. But besides such usual instances of transposition there are
throughout the poem many small groups of verses, forming generally
sentences complete in themselves, which have got quite out of their
right place: comp. 1 984—987 (998-1001), 11 652—657 (655-659 689)
and 1v 1227 1228 (1225 1226), three passages first transposed by me 3 also
11 1139—1142, 1168—1170, 111 686-690, 1v 50—52, v 170 171, 1127
1128. Now that a scribe should so often transpose several consecutive
verses always forming an entire and independent sentence by mere casual
carelessness, is to me in the highest degree improbable. Again most of
these passages read to me like possible additions not necessary to the
context, though they improve it. I believe them then to be marginal
additions by the poet, inserted on the same principle as the longer sections
discussed above: these too the first editor, faithfully preserving every-
thing in his copy, but not caring always to find the right place for what
the author left ambiguous, has inserted out of their order. Add to these
v 437—442 which the context could dispense with: these vss. are found
out of place in Macrobius as in our mss. This increases the probability
that they were out of their proper order from the first, two independent
authorities Macrobius and our archetype quoting them in the same way.
Perhaps these single vss might be added to the list, 1 1085 or 1086, 1v
189, 205, v1 957, 1225, 1237, as they might all be dispensed with.
Look too at 1v 129-142, 30 strangely'disordered in the mss: 133-135
may be all marginal additions by the author afterwards wrongly placed
by the editor. The ms. arrangement of 1v 299—348 has been already
accounted for. If all these passages are subtracted, there will then be
left a not very unusual number of single verses transposed by the
ordinary negligence of copyistS. The numbers occasionally given on
the left hand of the page denote of course the order of the lines in mss.
