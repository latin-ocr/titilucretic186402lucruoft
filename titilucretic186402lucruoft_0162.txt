inane his most general term for void, used as a subst. 3 the τό κενόν of the
Greeks: he also uses vacuum, vacuum inane, inane vacansque and the
like: spatium, omne quod est spatium, vacuum spatium, locus, locus ac
spatium and the like express space in its extension, wherein things are
and through which atoms move: χώρα, ‘tovos-z it is intactile or ‘manet
intactum 3 οἷναφής φύσις, 88 it is defined by Epicurus. 331 Quod 009-
nosse=a nomin. subst. as shewn by Nec sinet: this use of the infin. is
common in Lucr. as 111 67, 354, 731, 1v 765, 836 foll. 843 foll. v 979,
1118, 1250, 1297 foll. 1379, 1406, 1407, VI 380, 415, 416. Lucr. also
uses the infin. for an accus. subst.: see n. to 418. 332 quaerere, as 11
9 viam palantis quaerere vitae 3 and our ‘to be to seek'. 333 summa
rerum, properly the whole sum, universe of things in being, while haec
rerum summa is this our single world, as explained in n. to 235 3 but
comp. what I say at 1008 011 rer. sum. where I attempt to account for
the occasional ambiguity of this term: it is most important in Lucr. ‘-
always to bear in mind what res means in such connexions. 336 offi—

cium, Officere: one of his favourite plays on words, united with allitera- -
tion obstare. .omrei...0mnibus 3 on which comp. what is said above p. j
106: the words are simple homonymes, as in Cic. pro Sex. Rosc. 112 ·
cur mihi te offers ac meis commodis officio simulato officis et obstas,
340 subl. caeli: see n. to 315. sublima: Enn. trag. 5 seems to have
sublimas, and Attius sublimo and sublima 3 Fore. quotes sublima nebula ,ᾖ
from Sallust frag: Lucr. uses more than once the adv. sublime, but ’ἓ
never the adj. sublimis: he has also hilaro, but not the other form of ξ
that adj. 341 mul. mod. mul. a favourite formula of his for the rea· Ξ
80118 mentioned in n. to 336. 343 sollicito, an epithet he thrice gives
to motus: Virgil applies it to mare, Ovid to ratis. Lucr. uses the verb ἓ
more than once in similar senses. priv. car. seems very tautological:
comp. 275 and 293. 345 and he assumes the inherent motion of his ᾗῇ
atoms as the first requisite for the production of things. 346 solidus
is his technical word for what is perfectly solid and impenetrable, that 3
is his first—beginnings3 111 this sense no res can be solida3 only appa·
rently so: all res or things in being are rarae, that is have a mixture of ἷὲξ
void in them. 349 flent: Virg. georg. 1 480 inlacrimat templis ebur 3 ³
for which Seneca Thyestes 702 1188 flevit in templis ebur: but in Lucr. {ss
of course there is no secondary implying of real weeping. 352 totas ἶ
agrees with arbores implied in arbusta which, as is observed to 187, 110 ξ
always uses for the former: quite similar is VI 188 Quam sint lata mayisf ¹
quam sursum eontracta, referring to nubibus 3 and on the other hand 215 ss. i
eas, though 214 ‘nubila caeli is the immediate antecedent, not nubes:
757 quadripedes...ut si sint mactata 3 for which Lach. unskilfully reads.
fit mactatu’3 and not unlike is 1v 933 aeriis auris...eiu3, where see-,3
note. 355 rv'qidum seems to personify cold as if it were stiff likea}
