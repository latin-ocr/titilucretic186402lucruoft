redhibeo: reltalo of old eds. is a barbarism. 525 Adversa asp. :as-
pargini nimb. ex adverso. asparqine: comp. 1 719 asparqit, and n.
there. 526 arquis the best mss. of Cic. de nat. deor. 111 51 have the
same form.

527—534: all other like things, whether existing by themselves or
formed in the clouds, snow wind hail frost, may be all easily explained,
if you understand the properties of atoms. 527 sorsum crescunt is
intended to be a. verbal as well as real antithesis to concrescunt. 530
qeli: see n. to v 205. may. dur. aq. and 531 Et mora cet. are dif-
ferent expressions for the same thing and are both explanations of the
vis qeli: the iteration is designed to be emphatic: Virg. geor. 1V 136

qtaeie cursus frenaret aquarum. 531 mora: see n. to 453. 532
tamen, notwithstanding their number and variety, they may yet be all
readily explained. 533 quareve :quarequet see n. to Ι 57.

535-556; earthquakes have more than one cause: underground
are caverns rocks rivers lakes: well when any of these caverns tumble
in, whole mountains may fall and shake the earth: or if a mass of
earth tumble into the large pools of water, the oscillation of the water
may make the earth recl—Epic. in Diog. Laer. x 105 106 attributes
earthquakes to somewhat similar combinations of causeS, and adds in his
usual way καὶ κατ’ ἄλλους δὲ τρόπους πλείους τὰς κινήσεις ταύτας τῆς γῆς
γίνεσθαιε Seneca devotes the whole of the sixth book of his nat. quaest.
to the same subject: chap. 20 recounts first the theories of Democritus,
and then of Epicurus: Seneca here and in what precedes and follows
illustrates Lucr. better than Epicurus does, having had access of course
to larger works of the latter: veniamus nune ad 603 qui omnia ista quae
rettuli in eausa esse dixerunt aut ex his plura. Democritus plura putat.
ait enim motum aliquando spiritu fieri, aliquando aqua, aliquando
utroque, just as Luci-‚z then 20 5 omnes istas posse esse causas Epicurus
ait pluresque alias temptat et alios qui aliquid unum ex istis esse ad-
firmaverunt corripit etc.: he then proceeds to employ wind and water in
much the same way as Lucr. does. 538 and 552 lucunas: see n. to
ΠΙ 1031. 538 lucunas, to distinguish it from lacus, may mean here
chasms not filled with water, a sense it often bears, though 552 he says
in ‘maqnas aqu'ae vastasque lucuna83 which would also shew that Zu-
cunas cannot well mean small pools in contradistinction to Zaeus3 so
that in fact it may be a mere poetical tautology, as 539 rupes deruptaque
saxa. 542 similem cet. : this appears to follow from Epicurus' ἰσονο-
μία or as Cicero de nat. deor. 1 50 translates it aequabilis tributio. ut
omnibus omnia paribus paria respondeant. 543 subi. supp. must
surely have their literal sense, referring to what he has just said is
below ground. Creech plainly and Lamb. apparently take the meaning

to be, ‘those points being assumed and taken for granted': the latter
