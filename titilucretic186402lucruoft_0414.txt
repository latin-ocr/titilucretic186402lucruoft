396 NOTES 11

would be little difference in sound and often none in writing between
aestatem lucem villam etc. and aestate etc.: Madvig gram. 230, 2 quotes
habere in potestatem, in amicitiam dicionemque populi Romani, and in a
note suggests this as the origin of the idiom, adding that you never find
in vincla habere: there is probably truth in this, but it would not apply
to in parietes quoted above: another explanation will of course apply
to the idiom which we find in Petronius sat. 42 fui enim hodie in
funus 3 and Prop. 1v (111) 9 60 ferar in partes ipse fuisse tuas. ¹714
comp. Manil. 111 271 oras, Quas riyat aestivis yravidus torrentibus amnis
Nilus. saepe: you would expect semper: Bentl. in consequence thinks
the v, spurious 3 but saepe seems sometimes to be used vaguely by
Lucr. as if it were almost an expletive: v 430 saepe answers to 11
1062 semper. ¹715 Aut quia cet: Sen. nat. quafflt. 1v 2 22 si Thaleti
credis, etesiae descendenti Nilo resistunt et cursus eius acto contra ostia
mari sustinent, and so Diodorus 1 38 2, who gives a very detailed account
of the causes assigned. '716 qui: see n. to 11 404. etesiae esse: 743
Remiyi oblitae: Cic. orator 152 sed Graeci viderint: nobis ne si cupiamus
quidem distrahere voces conceditur...at Ennius semel Scipio invicte, et
quidem nos [Arat. frag. 21] Hoc motu radiantis etesiae in vada ponti.
hoc idem nostri saepius non tulissent, quod Graeci laudare etiam solent.
Virgil brought the bad habit somewhat more into sasbion: see Wagner
quaest. XI 3. ¹718 Coyentes, coqunt: see n. to 1 875, and comp. Aen.
VI 684 tendentem, 685 tetendit. 725 Fluctibus, i. e. of the river.
ostia appears to be the accus. after oppilare: Cic. phil. 11 21 iisque oppi-
latis impetum tuum compressisset. 726 ruit: Virg. geor. 1 105 in the
opposite sense cumulosque ruit male pinquis harenae: ‘ruit‚ levels,
whereas ruam acervos Hor. sat. 11 5 22 means to heap up’ Conington.
¹727 Quo fit uti pacto=quo pacto fit uti: comp. 204 and n. to 11 1004:
fit uti has become so entirely a single particle in force, that he here says
fit uti fiat for fit, 729 Fit uti flant for fiunt: see also n. to 1 442 erit ut
possint. 729—734 116 gives the theory of Democritus which is nar-
rated with much clearness and fulness by Diodorus 1 39, who throws
great light on Lucr.: Democritus intended to refute the common opinion,
which Lucr. gives last: the snows melted in summer not on the Ethi-
opian mountains, but at the north pole, and were carried by the etesian
winds all the way up to the sources of the Nile where they were stopped
and collected by the high mountains and descended in rain. '730 et.
fl. aq. occurred v 742. 735—73'7 he concludes with the common
theory: Sen. l.l. 17 Anaxayoras ait ex Aethiopiae iuqis solutas nives ad
Nilum usque decurrere. in eadem opinione omnis vetustas fuit. hoc
Aeschylus Sophocles Euripides tradunt. sed falsum esse plurimis arqu-
mentis patet: Lucr. having never journeyed to the sources, is less positive
than Seneca: comp. the opening of Eurip. Hel. and Valckenaer diatr.
