Lucr. a very indefinite term : then we have seen summa omnis, summa
sammai totius omnis, summa summarum and the like are all synonymes
of the omne or universe: summa loci is the infinite void or space: as
then res is 1113 proper term for things in being, summa ‘rerum should

of worlds in being throughout infinite space, even as haec rerum summa
means this world of ours ε and this is its regular and usual meaning, as
502 Unde omnis rerum nunc constet summa creata, and 11 530 Ex

universe are always rising into being and perishing, and thus the rela-
tions between the res and the primordia are constantly changing 3 as too

and that of primordia got mixed together so inextricably, that some-
times, as in our present passage, summa rerum means the whole infinite
sum of matter, both things in being and atoms out of which they come:

619. Once, v1 606, as the context fixes the meaning, he ventures to
use rerum summa for haec rerum summa or laic mundus 3 while 649 it
has again its most extensive sense.

ματα ὅπου ἂν ἔστη.
