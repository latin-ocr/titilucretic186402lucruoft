INTRonucTION 97

Lucretius, whether I know that his poetry contains the' system of
Epicurus, I would confidently answer, Lucretius and the like are verse-
makers not poets 3’ and again ‘the poet speaks with Epicurus, when he
would extol pleasure‚ and with the perch, when he would praise virtue.'
But this is what Lucretius can and dces do: virtue at all events he can praise
00 1116 broad grounds accepted by the general feeling of the world, if he
is unable to adopt the narrow and intolerant views of his adversaries·

Lucretius possessed indeed in as high a degree as any Latin poet two
qualities which a poet can ill dispense with, the power of vividly con-
ceiving and of expressing his conceptions 10 words. This has enabled
him to master the great outlines of the epicurean universe of things, and
by a succession of striking images and eomparisons drawn from the
world of things which was going on before the eyes of him and his
readers to impress this same outline on their minds. The two first books
appear to be quitemfinished and to have received almost the last touches
of the author with the exception perhaps of a few lines in the first and
certain portions of the second, pointed out in their several places. The
greater part of these books is devoted to a very complete and system-
atical account of the natures and properties which belong to the two
great constituents of the universe, atloms and void. Given to him this
universe in working order there is much that is striking, much even that
may be true, much at all events that Newton accepted, in this descrip-
tion. We of course care, not for its scientific value or truth, but for its

' poetical grandeur and efficacy upon our imaginatione 3 and in these re-

spects we are most amply satisfied. The least interesting portions of these
books are perhaps the episodes in which the rival systems of Heraclitus
Empedocles and Anaxagoras are examined and refuted. They are closely
connected with the general subject and the poet is much in earnest, but,
as was indeed to be expected and as is pointed out in the proper place,
he could only criticise them from his own point of view and starting
from his own principles. The third book is likewise highly finished;
and in no portion of his work does he more fully display his power of
sustained and systematical reasoning. Here too, if his premisses are
granted, his arguments are striking and effective, and carried through
with the energy of a fanatica] conviction. The poetry and pathos and
earnest satire of the last 260 verses are of a very high order. The fourth
book is in a much less complete condition than those which precede.
Yet in the first part of it, in which the epicurean theory of images is
expounded‚ he wrestles with its gigantic difficulties and often overcomes
them with singular power energy and controversial addi-ess, And in
truth the most obvious objections to this doctrine of iniages apply almost
as strongly to the Newtonian theory of the emission of light which in
spite of them so long maintained its ground. The later sections of the
