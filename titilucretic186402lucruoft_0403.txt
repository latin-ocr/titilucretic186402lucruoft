BOOK VI 385

caloris est postrema riyoris’ : the second quia is at least as untrue as the
first: heat and cold fight because they are together 3 and therefore in the
spring, as also in the autumn. 3¹70 turbare is neut. : see n. to 11 126.
3¹74 Propterea freta cet. refers to 364 Nam fretus ipse anni cet. nomi-
nitanda: this word five times used by Lucr. seems scarely to be found
elsewhere.

379—422: such is the true explanation of thunder, not the follies
taught in the Tuscan rolls: if the gods do hurl the bolts, why do they
pass over the guilty and so often strike the innocent? why does Jupiter
thunder only when the sky is 0101111οᾶ2 why does he waste his bolts on the
8002 why not tell us to beware, if he wishes us to escape? why thunder,
if he wishes to take us unawares'l how 0011 110 hurl at once in so many
places? why destroy his own temples and statues? why so often strike the
mountain-tops‘l 379 Hoc, what I have just said: Wak. prefers to
take boc as the abl. ‘ut magis Lucretianum' 3 so that est will be for licet,
a· sense it never bears in Lucr. and the older writers: see notes 1 to V 533.
380 Per-spicere and videre have, as so often in Lucr., the force of substan-
tives: see 415 416 and n. to 1 331 ε Per-spicere cet. est hoc, non . . perquirere
cet. ipsam, in its reality. 381 Tyrrhena cet.: see Cicero and Pliny
quoted in notes to 86 foll. and Sen. nat. quaest. 11 32 quid, quod sutura
portendunt cet. hoc inter nos et Tuscos quibus summa est fulyurum perse-
quendorum scientia interest: nos putamus, quia nubes conlisae sunt, ful-
mina emitti. ipsi existimant nubes conlidi ut fulmina emittantur. nam
cum omnia acl deum referant, in ea opinione sunt, tamquam non quia facta
sunt siqnificent, secl quia siqnificatura sunt fiant: Cic. de div. 1 72 speaks
of the Etruscorum et haruspicini et fulyurales et rituales libri. retro
volventem ‘shew that in his time the Etruscan books were still read
in the original, from right to left, retro’ Niebuhr hist. 1 p. 111 n. 341:
I should have thought it simply meant unrolling, volumina evolventem,
retroversum volventem. ‘ Ι will remark by the way that by indicia
mentis Lucr. means to explain indiqitamenta’ ibid.: but Ι do not find
that the Etruscan bookS‚ which are here in question, had anything to do
with these indiqitamenta3 which appear on the contrary to have be-
longed to the purest form of the old Roman worship. 383—385 = 87
——89‚ which were copiously illustrated. 386 cle caelo: see n. to ΙΙ 51.

aversabile seems to occur only here. 392 peofiaeoz see n. to 11 360:
with this and 395 Turbine cet. comp. Aen. 1 44 Illum eoepirantem trans-
fioeo pectore flammas Turbine corripuit. documen seems to be in apposi-
tion with the preceding sentence: Socrates in the clouds 399 feels the
same difficulty, Εἴπερ βάλλει τούς ἐπιόρκους, πῶς οὐχὶ Σίμων’ ἐνέπρησεν
Οὐδὲ Κλεώνυμον οὐδὲ Θέωρον; καίτοι σφόδρα γ’ εἵσ’ ἐπίορκοι. 393 sibi
