the very 65561166 of whatever is, to have parts or extension in some
measure or other, for to take away all extension is to reduce a thing
only to a mathematical point, which is nothing else but pure negation
or nonentity.' Ibid. 1 6 5 “ it is plain that one and the same thing,
though intellectually divisible, may yet be really indiscerpible. And in-
deed it is not only possible, but it seems necessary that this should be
true.' The mystery is as great today as it was in the age of Lucr. One

which constitute the first or ultimate elements of all ponderable sub-

statical atoms.

619 ‘rerum summam is almost a play on words: it means the universe of
things in being, and at the same time the largest thing conceivable in
opposition to minimam: probably, Lucretius hardly felt the ambiguity,

old paralogism would be equal, because all infinites are equal: precisely
thus the Indian atomist, Kanadi, declared there would be no difference
in size between a mustard seed and a mountain, a gnat and an elephant,
each alike containing an infinity of particles: see Daubeny's atomio
theory p. 8: Henry More too 1. 1. argues ‘thus a grain of mustard
seed would be as well infinitely extended as the whole matter of the¹
universe, and a thousandth part of that grain 65 well as the grain itself?
Bentley in his Boyle lectures brandishes this weapon in the faces of the
epicureans as Lucr. does against the peripatetics. Newton in his Qnd
'letter to him admirably refutes the fallacy, giving at the same time its
clearest exposition. As we shall again encounter this fallacy in Lucr.
I will cite a few lines: ‘I conceive the paralogism lies in the position
. that all infinites are equal. The generality of mankind consider infinites
no other ways than indefinitely: and in this sense they say all infinitos
are equa13 though they would speak more truly if they should say they
are neither equal nor unequal, nor have any certain difference or pro-
