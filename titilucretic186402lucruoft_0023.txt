INTRODUCTION 5

cet.’ Pius’ edition was reprinted by Ascencius in 1514 with not a few
changes in text, some of them taken from the notes.

The next edition must be ever memorable in the history of Lucretius,
that published by Philip Giunta ‘ anno salutis. M.D.x11. mense martio '.
Whether this means 1513 new. style I cannot tell 3 but I know that he
dates a Gellius and a Romualdi vita as published in January 1513,
‘Leone pont. max. christianam R. P. moderante ' and ‘ Leonis X anno
primo'. Now Leo X only became pope in March of that year 3 so that
here he must be speaking of 1514, and in Florence at all events this
mode of dating seems to have been in common use. The editor was
Petrus Candidus who, great and important as the corrections are which
he has introduced, has yet used a copy of the first Aldine upon which to
make them, though he has never mentioned the name of Avancius. It
seems to have been the practice of those times to take at least whatever
was printed without acknowledgment: thus Giunta regularly made
booty of Aldus, Aldus of Giunta in turn. What is said in the present
caseis grounded on a close inspection of the two volumes. Candidus,
where he does not designedly leave him, follows Avancius in the mi-
nutest points of spelling and punctuation. The latter for instance says
in his pref-ace that he writes ‘veteres imitatus repertumst, itemst, neces-
sest' and the like: Candidus in his preface that ‘in tam culto, tam niti-
do, tam undecunque castigato poeta' he will not admit archaisms like
volqum, volnera; or nullast, haudquaquamst and the like. And so in
his text while rejecting Avancius' patefactast, volnere etc, he keeps his
fruqifhrenteis rapaceis and a thousand such forms which have no au-
thority in their favour, while those which he discardS, have much.
Lachmann always so hard upon Avancius says ‘huius ineptissimam
scribendi rationem Eichstadius studiose imitatus est ', but has not 3 word
of blame for Candidus

But whence has the latter got his many and brilliant corrections?
for few or none appear to come from himself. He says in his addi-ess
to Thomas Sotherinus that what he did was to collate all the vetusta
exemplaria that were in Florence and to expunge what was condemned by
the obeli of Pontanus and MarulluS, ‘ praestantissimorum aetate nostra
vatum'. He alludes of course to John Iovianus Pontanus and his friend
and pupil Michael Marullus, after Politian among the first scholars and
Latin poets of the most flourishing period of Florentine learning, the
latter half of the fifteenth century: ‘Marullo ed il Pontan’ have the
honour to be mentioned together by Ariosto in the Orlando XXXVII 8.
But Candidus goes on afterwards to speak only of Marullus ‘ cuius in hoc
opere censuram potissimum secuti sumus’ 3 and in a note at the end he
says that in changing the order of verses here and in most other places
he has followed the arrangement of Marullus. To Marullus therefore
everything which is peculial· to the J untine has usually been assigned,
whether in the way of praise, or of blame as by Victorius and by
J oseph Scaliger who inherit-ed among many other of his father's antipa-
thies his dislike to Marullus. But Lachmann has gone much farther
than this, and has given to him not only by oversight, as will be seen in
notes 1, much that belongs to older authorities3 but everything that
first appeared in Avancius' edition as well, calling the latter ‘fur im-
