Book v 341

τερατεύεσθαί τι πρός τούς πολλοῦς βουλομένοις, nay it 16 μάταιον, and even
μανικόν. Well then all the possible reasons which Lucr. has just given
of the motion of the stars are equally unrefuted by sense3 are equally
true therefore3 and though only one of them may apply to our world,
yet in the countless worlds, like and unlike ours, existing in the universe
they all may and must find their place, 1.1. 94 ἐὰν μή τις τὸν μοναχῇ
τρόπον κατηγαπηκῶς τούς ἄλλους ὥς κενούς ἀποδοκιμάζῃ, οὗ τεθεωρηκώς τί
δυνατὸν οἷνθρῶπῳ θεωρῆσαι καὶ τί ἀδύνατον, καὶ διὰ τοῦτ’ ἀδύνατα θεωρεῖν
ἐπιθυμῶν.

534—563: the earth remains at rest in the midst of the world,
because its weight gradually diminishes and below it is another nature
closely connected with the air above the earth τ thus the whole forms as
it were an organic whole, and one part does not weigh down another
any more than one member of the body another member, the whole
having been united and working together since its first formation: 666
1300 how the light soul sustains and puts in motion the whole heavy
body. 534 Terraque: Lucr. does not tell us what the shape of the
earth is 3 but he must have conceived it as presenting a surface more or
less fiat both above and below. 535 Evanescere cet. i.e. below on the
under-surface: evanescere et decrescere, as 625 Evaneseere, imminui,
seems a· decided ὕστερον πρότερονε for the latter must have place before
the former. 538 vivit: 666 11. 130 476 viva: yet it does appear harsh
to apply this epithet to the bruta terra, the model of Quid sit vitali motu
sensuque remotum: perhaps he was thinking of it as forming a sort
of organic body with the air, like the human body with which he pro-
ceeds to compare it. Epic. in Diog. Laer. X 74 says merely καὶ ἦ γῆ τῷ
ἀέρι ἐποχεῖταιι Plut. de plat. phil. 111 15 assigns this to Anaximenes:
διὰ τὰ πλάτος ἐποχεῖσθαι τῷ οἷέρι. Pliny nat. hist. 11 10 gives an account
much resembling that of Lucr.: spiritus quem Graeci nostrique eodem
vocabulo aera appellant, vitalem hune et per cuneta rerum meabilem
totoque consertum, huius vi suspensam cum quarto aquarum elemento
librari medio spatii tellurem cet.: a stoic might perhaps have pointed
to his fierce attack on their cosmical system Ι 1052 Illud in his rebus
lonqe fuye credere cet. and argued that after all his mode of supporting
his earth in space did not 60 11111611 differ from theirs: but what he
objected to in them was their making the universe finite, our one mundus
111 fact, which he argues could not be held together amid an infinite
void: atoms infinite in number are always streaming up on all sides to
supply our world. The stoic Manilius 1 194 from the earth argues to
the mundus, his universe: N ec vero tibi natura admiranda videtur
Pendentis terrae debet, cum pendeat ipse Mundus et in nullo ponat
vestigia fundo. 545 quid obeat 1. 6. quod munus obire debeat, what
its proper and regular function is,
