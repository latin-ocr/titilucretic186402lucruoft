2 12 NOTES 11

see 11. to 1 1001 (997) z but here it is not quite certain. 531 protelo:
1v 191 Et quasi protelo stimulatur fulqere fulqur: from the passages of
Lucilius and others quoted by Forc. the word appears to denote a num-
ber of draught-oxen yoked one in front of the other and advancing by
even successive pulls: hence it well expresses the effect produced by the
· 601113111110118 811666881011 of blows of atoms.

532 Nam quod cet. an apparent objection to some shapes having an
infinite number of atoms, but only apparent: the quod vides is like the
familiar quod scribis in 016610, to introduce his own answer or opinion:
quod is the conjunction: see 11. 130 1v 885. 535 numerum: so as to
bring it up to an average. 537 anquimartus 1661118 v 1303 as the acc.
plur. fem. t Lach. quotes Priscian to shew that centimanus unimanus and
the like are declined like manus and observes that Lucr. is the only
writer of authority who uses any of these words except in the nom. and
acc. sing: Cic. de nat. deor. 11 122 manus etiam data elephanto est.
538 I know no other mention of this fable. 543 orbi: see 11. 130 1
978. 546 quod superest: see 11. to 1 50. 547 sumam hoc quoque
uti: not only grant that there could be a thing sole of its kind, but that
the elements of such thing finite in number were scattered through
the universe: euphony has determined the position of the 1101118, 68
Quippe etenim hoc quoque uti would have had a very harsh sound: comp.
too 1V 7 52 Nunc iqitur docui quoniam. 550 turba aliena, of atoms
different in kind. 555 fl. apl: Cic. Arat. frag. XXII Navibus ab·
sumptis fluitantia quaerere aplustra. aplustre, in plur. aplustra or aplus-
tria, was a fan-like erection of planks rising above the poop: Lucan
111 585 dum puqnat ab alta Puppe Tayus Graiumque audax aplustre
retentat. 559 comp. v 1004 Nec poterat quemquam placidi pellacia
ponti Subdola pellicere in fraudem ridentibus undis: Virgil has the
adj. pellam: these two appear to be the only good writers who use the
1101118. 561 aevom: 80 111 605 omnem...per aevom 3 Plautus 1168
vitalem aevum. 567 Esse iqitur cet.: he assumes now that he has
proved the question stated 522 fol.: the whole paragraph therefore
stands in closest connexion one part with the other. 568 palam est
:apertum est, is found also in Cicero: comp. too 111 355 ipsa palam
quod res dedit ac docuit nos: so v 1157 id fore clam. un. om. sup.
i. 6. 1111116 01111116 primordia, quae suppeditantur, suppeditantar.

569—580: thus production and destruction alternately prevail‚ their
elements ever waging equal war: no day passes without some dying,
some being born. 569 itaque: for its place in the sentence 866
n. to 1 419 011 iqitur. itaque: because the 61301118 of each shape being
infinite, those which tend to preserve or destroy anything are alike
infinite. 571 rer. qen. auct. mot. i. e. motus principiorum quae generant
