BOOK v 347

serpens, 693 lustrans: see notes 1 for three other instances in which
Lach. has corrupted his author from a vain objection to two participles
in such a connexion as this: Cicero in his Aratea again and again has
examples of thiS, and in the parts most imitated by Lucr. as 237 Quat-
tuor aeterno lustrantes lumine mundum, orbes stelliyeri portantes siyna
feruntur, Amplexi terras caeli sub teymine fulti: 260 recedens, devitans 3
264 consistens, distinyuens 3 332 lustrans, conficiens 3 379 depellens, pan-
dens 3 progn. fr. 3 Cana fuliae fuqt'ens, clamans, fundens: Lach. in
support of his violent and clumsy changes has these words ‘nam via
solis obliqua est, totus obliquus zodiacus, lumen solis nequaquam semper
obliquum est' 3 the point of which so far as Lucr. and the latitude of
Rome Berlin or Cambridge are concerned I have in vain attempted to
see: with 692 and 693 lustrans comp. Manil. 111 515 Annua quod lus-

every day. sic refers of course to 696 quia crossior est cet. '703

year. certa desurqere parte: Hor. sat. 11 2 76 ut pallidus omnis Cena

prove that a v. is here lost: unless it be so, there is nothing to indicate
that 116 18 speaking of the daily creation of a new sun, as 116 manifestly
must be doing: comp. too the similar way in which he concludes his
discussion of the moon in the next paragraph, 748—750 Quo minus est
mirum si certo tempore luna Giynitur et certo deletur tempore rusus cet.
Among those who thus ‘seem to speak the truth’ was Heraclitus, who
also held like Epicurus that it was εὖρος ποδὸς ἀνθρωπείου.

'705—'750 : the moon may borrow its light from the sun, increasing
as it recedes from him, until, when directly opposite, it shews its full
face3 and again diminishing as it again approaches: in this case the
moon must be a round ball moving below the sun: it may shine too
with its own light, and its partial or total concealment may be caused
by an opaque body invisible to us getting between it and us in various
ways: or thirdly it may be a ball half bright half opaque which pre-
sents to us all these various phases, as the Ohaldees assert in opposition
to the first hypothesis, that of the astronomers: 01· lastly a ncw moon
may be born daily, each successively presenting a different phase : thus
many things, for instance the four seasons, come round in regular order.—
