duce it: but, mind, it is not every element that 'can beget sense 3 only
certain atoms with certain shapes and arrangements: but even these
woods and clods may, as we have seen, give birth sometimes to living
things. But they who say that sense can only come from what has
sense, suppose elements to be soft, as we never see sense united but with
what is soft: yet suppose such elements eterna13 they must have the
sense of some part or of the whole living thing: but no part can feel
away from- the whole thing: well then these elements must be like the
whole living thing: if they are living then, they are thereby liable to
death 3 but even if they are not, they would make but a medley of living
things, like the impossible unions of men and brutes: but if they lose
their own sense, why then give it only to take it away? nay we have
just seen that sense can come from what has no sense. 886 animum
percutit seems almost proverbial: Ter. Andr. 125 Percussit ilico animum 3
Cic. ad Att. IV· 8 b 3 audivi. . Romae esse hominem. . percussit animum.
88¹7 varios sensus i. e. varias sententias: it is very probable that his fre-
quent use 01 sensus with its primary meaning in this part of his poem
‘has prompted him to use it here, rather than avoid it, in a different sig-
nification: see 11. to 1 875. 894 quantula, because the atoms which
go to produce sense and life are of the smallest and finest kind. 896
quae sint i. e. qualia sint. 901 Conc. ita ut debent i. e. Cone. tali con· .

fama that they give them sense they thereby make them soft. 907

true reading is not certain. 922 (921) nequeant is potential: see 850
and comp. 11. to 1 327. 925 quid opus: for surely if an element first
lose sense, it is the same as if it had never had it. 926 foll. tum prae-

931—943 ε ‘if it be said sense comes from what has not sense by a
process of change or a sort of birth, I answer, birth and change both
imply a previous union: before the creature is begotten, its body cannot
- have sense, as its matter is dispersed abroad and has not come together
in a way to awake any of the senses’.—This passage is obscure: 110 must
apparent-ly be alluding to the stoics. Plut. de stoic. repugn. 41 of Chry-
