is in Lucr., this is the only instance of hac re :hanc ob rem t Cic. epist.
ad fam. xnI 46 ea re. 1¹73 secreta means of course distinct and pecu-
116-1· to each.

174 Cic. Tusc. disp. v 37 says neque est ullum quod non ita vi9eat...
ut aut flores aut sruqes fundat aut bacas: the flores aut fruyes fundat
answers precisely to rosam—frumenta-—simdi 3 but then for vites you
would expect uvas to complete the parallel 3 so that vites fundi seems to
be said with a change of meaning and to=fundere se, i.e. fetus: comp.
351 Crescunt arbusta et fetus in tempore fundunt. 1¹78 tempestates
from the context implies the due seasons, as Lamb. rightly interprets;
for adsunt can hardly mean, as Wak. explains it, ‘are propitious': a god
adest stands by and by that very act is propitious3 and the same of
praesens 3 but that does not apply to tempestas. 181 at. al. par. an.
Virg. was prob. thinking of this expression and rhythm when he said
georg. 11 149 atque alienis mensibus aestas. 183 concilio is 0116 of his
regular technical words for the uniting of the atoms to form a res: the
verb is used in the same way. For the double abl. comp. Madv. Lat.
gram. 27 8 a: he quotes one clause of Cic. Brut. 315 with 3 abl. meo
iudicio tota Asia illis temporibus disertissimus: the words there, as here,
admitting no ambiguity: 1021, repeated v 419, has also three, neque
consilio primordia rerum Ordine se suo quaeque saqaci mente locarunt:

comp. 11 218 Ponderibus propriis incerto tempore ferme Ι ncertisque loci ·
spatiis decellere 3 v 296 multa caliqine taedae Consimili properant ratione

ardore ministro Suppeditare. 184 porro a very favourite word of
Lucr. with all the 8611868 primary and secondary of our ‘ further'. 185

ad after or upon : vl 316 ad ictum: Cic. Verr. lv 32 quo solitus esset uti
ad hospitum adventum 3 Sen. de benef. IV 6 6 nunc ad surqentem iwm ἓ
aetatem...pubertas. 186 infantiba' parvis: comp. Cic. orator 161 1.
quod iam subrusticum videtur, olim autem politius, eorwm verborum,
quorum eaedem erant postremae duae litterae quae sunt in optumus, pos-
tremam litteram detrahebant, nisi vocalis insequebatur. ita non erat ea
offensio in versibus quam nunc fuyiunt poetae novi. ita enim loquebamur ‘⁷‘

qui est omnibu’ princeps non omnibus princeps et vita illa dignu' locoque „
non dignus. This suppression of s is common in Lucr. and 18 not ²
avoided by Cicero himself in his verses: in all the older poets Ennius
Lucilius etc. it is of course very frequent. Prob. Cic. includes Catullus
among the poetae novi 3 though he has one instance of the licence in the ·
last v. of his poems, tu dabi’ supplicium: our 11188. with one doubtful
exception always write the s: Lamb. first suppressed it ε it is not at all
certain that the ancients did not write it 3 and perhaps Cicero means lo-
quebamur to contrast with scribebamus. Lucretius’ frequent employ- ²
ment of this archaism, after it had been generally dropt, may be 0116 of
the reasons which made Cicero deny him ars, if 116 indeed did deny it
