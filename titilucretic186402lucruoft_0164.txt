sic ordine transiqatur et omnibus explicatis peroratum sit....et ad primasm

and so v 291 primum iactum fulqoris quemque perire: also 264 primum
quicquid aquai, 284 primum quicquid fulqoris, 304 primum quicquid
flammarum, Lucretius loving the archaism quicquid for quicque, as has
been said above. 392 id fieri, i. e. that the space left between the
bodies continues to be filled with air without any void, because the air
which so fills it was condensed between the bodies when they were
close together: the subj. of course shewing it was the erroneous judg-
ment of the thinker, as was quia linquant in 373. 392 condenseat
and 395 denserier: Lucr. appears only to know the 2¹¹⁶ conjug. ε see notes

as VI 1190 nervi trahere: but if the law there laid down by Lach. be ς

 

true, as it would appear to be, the cases are not like 3 and in se trahere

rather resembles 787 inter se mutare: see n. there„ part. cond. in un.

398-417: much more might I say; but a keen intellect can now
by itself pursue the question farther: if however you demur, I have ’ξ
such store of arguments in reserve, that our life will come to an end ⁵
sooner than they. 398 Virg. ecl. lx 56 Causando nostros in lonqum -
ducis amores. 400 possum: comp. Virg. georg. 1 176 Possum multa ‘J
tibi veterum praecepta referre. 401 conradere is twice used in v1 in its
literal sense. 402 sayaci: see n. to 50: the metaph. is kept up in
vestiqia which furnish the scent; and the expressions naturally lead to .
the simile: comp. saqax nasum of Plautus, nare saqaci of Ennius. Δ
404 montivaqae agrees with ferai, as shewn by 11 597 and 1081. 405 .
quietes: I find no other instance of the word in this sense ; but Cic. de ’

like Virgil's tulerunt, shew that the quantity does not arise from the ff
