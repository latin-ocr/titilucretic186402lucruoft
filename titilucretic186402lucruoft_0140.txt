122 NOTES ΙΙ

epithet in Lucr. of animus and mens: the metaph. is from the scent of
dogs, and is well illustrated in Forcell. where however de nat. deor.
should be de divin. 51 Sem. a curis: wisdom and happiness being
iunattainable without οἷταραξία or perfect exemption from care and
trouble. veram ad rationem: Epicuri philosophiam: comp. v 9 vitae
rationem invenit eam quae N unc appellatur sapientia. ratio is as
common in Lucr. as it is in Cicero, and has perhaps as many meanings:
notice the word here and 54 and 59, the sense in each case different:
and comp. 128—130 ratio...quafiant ratione...rationc sayaci within three
lines. 11 1023 Nunc animum nobis adhibe veram ad rationem. 52
comp. Ciris 46 Accipe dona meo multum viyilata labore, in which there
is also a reference to 142 metes viqilarc serenae. disposta, as 111 420
perqam disponere carmina: it has the same sense as diyerere. 54 cle
sum. cae. rat. as below 127 superi-3 de rebus habenda Nobis cst ratio.
55 incipiam rather attempt than simply begin 3 so 1v 29 Nunc ayere in-
cipiam: see Prof. Conington to Aen. 11 13, who refers to Henry: the
two meanings however easily pass into one another: VI 432 Rumpere ζ
quam coepit nubem3 and so inceptum, coeptum. '¹
55 foll. rerum primordia or primordia alone is here declared by Lucr. 3
to be his proper and distinctivc term for the atonis or first elements of ξ
things. Once, IV 28, he oddly resolves it into ordia prima3 sometimes ’ἒ
he has instead of it cunctarum exordia rerum. In the gens dat. and abl. ἔ
where these words do not suit his verse, he uses principiorum and prin- 4ε
cipiis, in the plur. only: 707 princifflum applies to those philosophers Ξ
who had only one first-beginning. principia he never employa thus i}
shewing that primordia is his proper and distinctive term, and the other ἐ
a mere substitute, which he need not therefore here mention: 11 313 ἶ
primorum is used for principiorum. ‘ First-beginnings' seems to me to Ἴ
give the peculiar force of the term better than any other word I can hit
upon: α’ρχαί, τῶν ὄντων αἶρχαί and the like are the equivalents in Epi-
curus and others. He goes on to enumerate several synonymes: matc-
ries i. q. ὕλη, corpora yenitalia or prima 3 corpora alone or corpora rerum
is more common and used at least as often as primordia,· corpuscula too ,ἢ
is not uncommon: semina rerum which he mentions here or semina
alone is frequent enough. σώματα, ἄτομα σώματα and the like in Epi- ’
curus. Lucr. has no equivalent for αἱ ἄτομοι or ἄτομα σώματα. Cicero ἑ
uses corpuscula, atomi, id est individua corpuscula, and individuum as a
subst. to express the atoms of Epicurus or Democritus. Lucr. does not here ξ ’
mention clementa which is not rarely found in his poem and answe-rs to ,-
one of the commonest Greek words στοιχεῖα. ὄγκοι, bulks or magnitudes, ⁷,
often occurs in Epicurus Sextus and others. N one of the above terms ‚1
is employed by Lucr. in the sing. to denote one atom except corpus once {l
