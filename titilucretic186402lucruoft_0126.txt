'108 NOTES 11

older literature seems to have been headed by unskilful and too zealous
leaders and thus to have exposed itself to the shafts of satire. The
effect which Dryden and Pope produced for some generations on English
poetry gives but a faint notion of the sovereignty exercised by the Au-
gustan poets. And yet Lucretius had no slight influence on the poetry
of succeeding ages, although the first mention of his verses according to
the interpretation usually given is anything but complimentary. I allude
of course to a sentence of Cicero written a few months after the poet’s
death and probably at the very time when his poem was first published.
At the end of a short letter to his brother Quintus, 11 11, written early
in 700, occurs this sentence as it is given in all mss. Lucretii poemata
ut scribis ita sunt multis luminibus inqenii multae tamen artis. N early
all editors are now agreed in writing ita sunt, non multis cet. 3 but sense
alone must determine the right reading: to put non before multae tamen
artis is quite as easy an emendation. What then is Cicero’s meaning?
we have not the criticism of Quintus which called forth the remark to
enlighten us. At this period when the νεώτεροι, as Cicero calls them,
were striving to bring the Alexandrine style into fashion, there seems to
have been almost a formal antithesis between the rude genius of Ennius
and the modern art. It is not then impossible that Quintus may so
have expressed himself on this head, that Cicero may mean to answer
‘yes you are quite right in saying that Lucretius has not only much of
the native genius of Ennius, but also much of that art which to judge by
most of the poets of the day might seem incompatible with it! Thus the
mss. would be right and Cicero's judgment would satisfy us. Again to
write either multae tamen etiam artis or multae etiam artis is hardly, if
at all a greater change than to insert non. Lachmann however has no
doubt that non must come before multis .· he says Cicero could not deny
to Lucretius art: ‘ quod in Marco sane mirandum esset, quippe qui eius
artis qua Lucretius pollet ne minimam quidem partem in carminibus
suis adsecutus esset. contra idem cur pauca inqenii lumina in Lucretii
carmine animadverterit, non potest obscurum esse: nam ei Ennius et
Attius ea re inqeniosi videbantur, quod oblectando docerent et animis
movendis corrigerent mores.’ But every one feels that inqenii lumina

means here precisely what we mean by genius 3 what Ovid means when '⁷

he says of Ennius Ennius inqenio mamimus, arte rudis, of Callimachus

Quamvis inqendo ‘non valet, arte valet, of himself broken hy calamity j,

N ec tamen inqenium nobts respondet, ut ante Impetus ille sacer qui
vatum pectora nutrit, Qui prius in nobis esse solebat, abest ,· what Ho-
race means by inqeni beniyna vena,· what Juvenal means when he says
of Demosthenes and Cicero utrumque Lamus et exundans Zeto dedit

inqenii fons. As it would not be well then in Cicero to deny Lucretius ‘²ssJ

’ infimum, if we must have a non, 1 should prefer to see it before multae.
