unwm: from the context ylomeramina would seem in our passage to
mean qlobosa primordia, the round particles of any liquid 3 but if so,
this sense is in strange contradiction to the meaning which Lucr. else-
where gives to it: if it means the drops into which a liquid sometimes
forms, that would only apply to a few cases in which a liquid so disperses
itself: the words retinentur inter 86 616 ambiguous, as they may refer
either to 6 composite body keeping together, or to the separate atoms
holding themselves in union. 455 proclive: see Cic. de fin. v 84
proclivi currit oratio, and Madvig there who shews that proclivi and
proclive are the same in meaning and used adverbially: he compares
facile and sublime, and refers to Gellius x 24 who says the ancients used
proclive and proclivi indifferently: Cic. Tusc. disp. IV 42 quia sunt in
lubrico incitataque semel proclivi labuntur. 460 laxa: fog and
smoke for example could enter the mouth or nostrils or eyes or other
open parts of the body: the action of flame is so different from these, it
is not easy to bring it into comparison with them. laxa is a slight
change and seems to suit the context. 463 acutis: so that they can
punqere, but not haerere. 465 Sudor maris is simply the salt water of
the sea, and has nothing in common with v 487, where salsus sudor is
literally the sweat of the earth 3 or with what is there quoted from
Empedocles. 467 doloris is the acc. plur.: it is certain that do-
loris laboris maioris and the like were often, if not generally written by
. Lucr. and virgil: see 509 melioris and v 591, and Wagner orthogr.
Verg. p. 404: creant doloris: 470 laedere sensus. 469 Scilicet esse:
866 11. to 1 210 Esse videlicet. 472 Neptuni: he takes himself the
licence here, which 652 (655) 116 somewhat contemptuously concedes
to others. 475 mansuescat by losing the aspera semina. 476 viri:
virus· isfused for the brine of the sea Ι 719, V 269, repeated VI 635,
Percolatur enim virus 3 Manil. v 684 ponti secernere virus.

477-521 : hence it appears that the number of different shapes in
atoms is finite: some atoms must be infinitely large, if you have an
infinite variety of shapes 3 for say certain atoms consist of three parts or
four parts: their permutations will only give 6 certain number of shapes:
go on increasing the number of parts, the shapes after every change of
position will still be only finite in number: hence to get an infinite
number of shapes, some atoms must be infinitely large 3 which is impos-
sible: again were the shapes infinite, what is now best in colour smell
flavour sound would be far surpassed 3 as well as what is worst: but as
it is 1311616 18 6 11111113 130 611 131118; there is a limit too to the heat and cold
of the year.— This was another point in which Epicurus differed from
Democritus and Leucippus who according to Arist. de gen. et corr. 1 1
p. 314 22 taught that their atoms ἄπειρα καὶ τὸ πλῆθος εἶναι καὶ τοῖς

μορφάς-τ p. 315 b 9 foll. he gives their reasons for this. Philoponus in
