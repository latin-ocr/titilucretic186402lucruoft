Boon v1 8 1

here. fiunt, fateare necessest Pleraque dissolui Lach. most unsuitably, as
if only pleraque, not omnia, were to be dissolved. fiunt possuntque, n.
P. dissolui Bern. to which the same objection applies. Lamb. seeing this
difficulty, in ed. 2 and 3 gives fiunt fientque, necesse Esse ea dissolui.
47—49 an exceedingly corrupt passage ; yet Ι fancy that Ι have emended
it without much violence: in 4¹7 I have changed nothing 3 after it there is
manifestly a hiatus of several verses, the general sense of which I have
attempted to give in my translation. The ms. reading of 48 and 49 is
as follows, Ventorum eccirtant placentur omnia rursum Que fuerint sint
placato conversa favore: with exirtant for esc ira ut, comp. 1v 820 virtuti
for vir uti. omnia for omina is an almost unfailing blunder of mss.

furore is from Lamb. ed. 2 and 3, and Auratus for favore. The older Α

emendations in Ald. 1 J unt. Lamb. etc. are so devoid of all probability
that I will not cite them: Lamb. indeed believes the lines not to be
Lucretius’3 nor is Lachmann's text much happier: institui conscendere
currum Ventosum et certant plangentia flamina rursum, Quae fuerint,
sine, placato conversa furore .· then at 50 he begins a new paragraph, and
52 for Et faciunt gives Haec faciunt, though Lactantius twice over has
the ms. reading. Bern. supposes a lacuna both before and after 48 which
he thus leaves, Ventorum eaeistant, placentur omnia rursum: 52 J unt.
Lamb. etc. for Et faciunt have Efficiunt. 56 57:90 91= 1 153 154:
here in the 6th book Lach. rejects them in the first, retains them in the
second place: to me it is manifest that in both places they come from
the annotator who thought they were in point and consequently jotted
them down in the margin in his usual fashion. 68 lonqeque Nic. N icc.

Avanc. Lamb. ed. 1 and 2 for est ratio caelisque tenenda: the scribe
omitted specie because of the following squete. est ratio fulqencli visque
tonandi Lach. which seems to me most improbable. est ratio superum

caelique Flor. 31 Gamb. 2 Vat. Lamb. ed. 3. 85-89 Lach. encloses in
[]. 90 91:56 57: 1 153 154: see above. Lach. admits them here.
92 acl candida calcis Lamb. and Turnebus for ac candida callis: a certain
emendation.
