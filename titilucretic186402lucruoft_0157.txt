BOOK 1 139

Hectoreum, sinusque ‘crepantis carbaseos: Lucr. is certainly not harsher
than Virgil: comp. too 11 342 mutaeque natantes Squamiyerum pecudes;
and see n. to V 13 divina antiqua reperta, where the instances are some-
what different. Lucr. is fond of this periphrastic use of uvwr: he has
umor aquae, aquai, aquarum, sudoris, some of them repeatedly. 260 Ar-
tabus: this form is retained by our mss. in four other places ε once only,

, v 1077, we find artibus: this is one out of many instances of their value

 

in points of spelling: doubtless the u was retained longer in this than
in other words, to distinguish it from the dat. and abl. of ars. 261
perculsa: see n. to 13. 262 videntur (perire). 263 alid Lucr.
uses not unfrequently 3 ali the dat. sing. more than once, but alis never.
263 Lucr. is fond of this doctrine that the death of one thing is the birth
of another and that the uniformity of nature is thereby maintained. We
shall have to say more at 11 70 of this theory as applied to the universe
of things: as here applied to this world of ours it is hardly perhaps
consistent with what is said 556, that the process of destruction is much
quicker than that of construction. Elsewhere too he argues at great
length and with much earnestness that this world is of quite recent
formation, and again that it not only can but must and will be destroyed
in a moment of time. What becomes then of this unvarying equality,
at least thus unconditionally applied, nec ullam Rem qiqni cet? Lucr.
doubtless had running in his thoughts the old dogma of the physici,
more than once asserted by Aristotle‚ as metaph. 11 2 p. 994 b 5 ἦ θα-
τέρου φθοραὶ θατέρου ἐστὶ γένεσις.

265—328: ‘doubt not what I say of first-beginnings, because they are
not seen: many things in being you know by their effects, yet cannot see:
winds work mischief in sky, on earth and 363 3 yet are not seen: they act
by pressure just like rivers which are seen: smells heat cold sounds are
not seen 3 yet have all body since they are in contact with sense: moisture
leaves clothes without being seen: metals stones wear away3 things grow,
and decay, as rocks from sea-brine 3 yet the process of growth and decay
is unse-en in all ’. 265 Nunc aye, a not unfrequent formula in Lucr. by
which 116 bids his reader to give heed‚ when he is passing to a new ques-
tion: it is used more than once in the same way by Virgil‚ and often by
Manilius: Cicero has aye nunc: comp. too Empedocles 248 Karsten Νῦν
