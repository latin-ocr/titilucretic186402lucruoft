INTRODUCTION 99

In style and language Lucretius has manifestly adopted a somewhat
archaic tone, differing more or less from that of his extant contemporaries.
This has been occasioned mainly by his admiration for Ennius and
Naevius and the old tragic poets Pacuvius and Attius: their extant frag-
ments prove how carefully he had studied them. In Greek literature
too his tastes seem to have carried him to the older and more illustrious
writerS. In this as in so many other respects he seems to have stood
quite aloof from the prevailing fashions of his day 3 for the great mass of
contemporary poets, among them even Catullus at all events in his
heroic and elegiae poems, chose to form their style after Euphorion of
Chalcis and the affected AleXandrine school 01 poets, Callimachus and
the rest, whose influence extended far into the Augustan age, though
they wrote in what was to themselves really a dead language. It is
owing probably in great measure to his admiration for Lucretius that
Virgil and thereby Latin poetry were saved from falling even more than
they did under this baneful infiuence. Epicurus of course Lucretius
would study for other purposcs than those of style, in· which he would
have found him but a sorry master 3 but the Greek writers still wholly
or partly extant, whom, to judge by his imitations of them, he most
loved and admired‚ were Homer Euripides Empedocles Thucydides and
Hippocrates. Doubtless too 110 had carefully studied the old philoso-
phers Democritus Anaxagoras and Heraclitus, but mainly for their phi-
losophy. Plato he would seem to have known something of from more
than one passage of his poem. His illustrious contemporary Cicero had
like him an intense esteem for EnniUS, a profound contempt for the ‘ can-
tores Euphorionis ’ who presumed to despise Ennius Many years before
Lucretius wrote his poem Cicero in boyhood had translated the works
of Aratus. This translation of which large fragments are preserved
shews much spirit and vivacity of language, though its poetica] merits
cannot be mentioned beside those of Lucretius. Yet the latter sti-angely
enough, moved it may be by his general admiration for the man, had
made this youthful production one 01 1118 models of style, as may be de-
monstrated, not by one or tw0‚ but by twenty manifest imitations of the
few hundred lines still existing. In poetica] diction and metrical skill
Lucretius has surpassed not only this boyish essay, but doubtless their
common master Ennius as well ,· for the first inventor is naturally left
behind by his followers. Yet Lucretius undoubtedly wished it to be
known that the latter was his master and model in Latin poetry. Free
from all jealousy and empty pretension, and in this as in so many other
respects unlike his teacher Epicurus, he took every opportunity of ac·
knowledging his obligations to those to whom he felt indebted: first and
foremost to Epicurus who shewed the path which leads to truth and
reason without which all other gifts were vain, and after him to Demo-
