etiasm seems clearly to have reference to recepta: quamvis recepta, tamen
non potuere etiam consociare: comp. with this sic deinde locutus for aio
loo. deinde, and the like, in Virgil. 112 uti memoro = ita uti eam
memoro: 1v 749 H aec fieri ut memoro. simulacrum and imayo are
cxactly synon.: in 1v 110 regularly uses imaqo 111 the sing. or imayinibus,
simulacra in the plur. nom. and acc. for the εἴδωλα of Epicurus. 114

loosely put for the air which serves as a place for these motes to move
about in, and therefore is to them what the real inane is to the atoms:
just below 151 he contrasts the air which is not inane vacuum with 158
the real inane vacuum: Aen. xn 906 vacuum per inane is still more-
loosely put for the air. 117 lumine in ipso: 800 11. to 1v 736 aere in

puynant proeliant, turbas lites, morbum mortem, donum praemium, from
Plautus and Terence. 119 dare pausam, like dare motum, discesswm,

here: 111 377 it means only, so much and no more: a more usual sense.
The new corp. inser. Lat. will shew that it was a very old legal term, which

what Lucr. wrote, not proporro, we might compare Aen. 1 7 2 and 157

ap. see 11. to Ι 826: this verb occurs ten times in Lucr. and is always
spelt by our 11188. appareo: 80 apparo, appello (both 1 and 3 conj.); but
adpetitur and always adpono, adporto or atporto, in which words the
separate force of the preposition continued to be felt: in exact conformity
with this the new corp. inscr. Lat. vol. 1 has twenty times appareo, and
also apparitor, proving that in the earliest times the prepos had been
assimilated in this common technical word: thus too in the twenty-one
instances of appareo in Virgil all Ribbeck's mss. always have app. except
