thenes. 587 Disturbat: see n. to 1 70 Inritat. 595 tremere atque
movere: 1190 nervi trahere et tremere artus 3 where Lach. attempts to
define when you may or may not use trahere or movere for trahi or
‘moveri : if a man’s limbs are moved by himself or by a sensible exter-nal
cause, you must use the passive membra moventur 3 if no cause be appa-
rent, then you may say ¹membra movent 5 and thus terra movet, because
it has no power of moving itself nor do you perceive why it moves: on
this principle he will not 111 571 tolerate the movere of mss. but reads
moveri with Lamb.: the same reasoning applies to trahere for trahi: of
course in all cases the passive may be used. 601 Proinde licet quam-

ut Carneades solebat: metuo ne soli philosophi sint3 where Bentl. ‘bene

reminding us how great the delusion of many is in supposing that our
world is eternal: this he has refuted at great length in the early part of
V: our mundus and every other mundus will perish as certainly as the
universe, the summarum summa, will be immortal and unchangeable for
evei-lasting.

608—638: the sea does not grow lai-ger, because its size is enormous
compared with the supplies from rivers and springs and rains: the sun
and winds too and clouds all draw off much, as they act upon so wide a
surface: then as water comes through the porous earth into the sea, it
passes in like manner from the sea back to the earth.—Manifestly, as
Lach. shews, this paragraph has no connexion in language and not
much in meaning with what precedes and follows, and must be a later
addition of the poet's, not properly embodied with the rest. 612
