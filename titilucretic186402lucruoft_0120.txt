express in Latin Anaxagoras’ homoeomeria, but the meaning he can
expound easily enough. And easily and lucidly enough 116 does explain
it: the less 116 or any other poet Latin or Greek or English 1168 10 do
with the word itself the better: it is not more poetical than entele-
chia or homoeusia or the τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι itself. The third passage is
111 218 foll. where he says that he would fain explain at greater length
the way in which the different substances which compose the soul are
mixed and work together, but the poverty of his native speech com-
pels him to be brief. Whether he is brief or not, he explains an intri-
cate question as clearly as any Greek writer in prose or verse would be
likely to do. One might more justly object to Lucretius that he has too
much instead of too little technical language for a poet. Whatever
Greek writer Cicero wishes to explain, he can find adequate Latin terms
to express the Greek, even if they are those of Plato or Aristotle: is it
a new sense given to a word in common 11861 116 can always meet λόγος
01· εἶδος with ‘ratio or species: is it 6 newly coined word ‘3 his qualitas is
quite as good as Plato’s ποιότης. N ay from the force of circumstances
species qualitas quantitas have had a much longer life and a far more
extended application than εἶδος ποιότης 6οᾶ ποσότης. Had Cicero chosen
to apply the prolific energy of his intellect to the task, he might have
invented and wedded to beautiful language as copious a terminology as
was afterwards devised by the united efforts of Tel-tullian and the other
fathers, Aquinas and the other schoolmen ; from which the most culti-
vated modern languages derive the chief portion of that wealth in scien-
tific terms which enables them to claim in that respect a superiority over
Latin. But the language of Latin poetry would assui-edly not have
been improved thereby. Ulphilas no doubt found his Gothic, Alfred
his English, when those idionis were in their prime, quite as poor in
their scientific tei-minology compared with the degenerate Latin of their
1111168, 68 Lucretius found his Latin compared with Greek. That however
he, like Cicero, sometimes entertained a more favour-able opinion of his
language and his art would appear from such expressions as the twice
recurring quod obscura de re tam lucida panyo Carmina, musaeo con-
tinyens cuncta lepore.

The Lucretian hexameter occupies an important place in the history
of Latin poetry, coming as it does between that of Ennius who invented
and that of Virgil who brought this metre to perfection. What Ennius
did in this matter is a curious study: 116 not only was the first to intro-
duce this new and strange form of verse into the language on which it
was to continue to exercise so great an influence ever after 3 but 116 laid
down for it laws of prosody differing in many essentia] points from those
observed by himself in his tragedies as well as by all the other tragic
and comio pocts of his own and the following age. These laws, 11608-
