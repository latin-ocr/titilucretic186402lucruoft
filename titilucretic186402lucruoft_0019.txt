ΟΝ ΤΗΕ FORMATION OF THE TEXT

IF Lucretius had come down to us with a text as uninjured as that
of Virgil and a few other ancient writers, he could scarcely have been
reckoned among the most difficult Latin poets. Certainly he would
have been more easy to explain than Virgil for instance or Horace 3 for
he tells what he has to tell simply and directly, and among his poetical
merits is not included that of leaving his reader to guess which of
many possible meanings was the one he intended to convey. Fortune
however has not dealt so kindly with him. Not that the great mass of
his poem is not in a sound and satisfactory state : in this respect he is
better off than many others3 but owing to the way in which it has
been handed down, his text has suffered in some portions irreparable
loss. It is now universally admitted that every existing copy of the
poem has come from ene original, which has itself long disappeared.

Of existing manuscripts a fuller account will presently be given:
let it suffice for the moment to say that the two which Lachmann has
mainly followed and which every future editor must follow, are now in
the library of Leyden. One is a folio written in the m‘nth century, the
other a quarto certainly not later than the tenth. Large fragments of
one, if not of two others, of the same age as the quarto and very closely
resembling it are also still preserved, partly in Oopenhagen, partly in
Vienna. These manuscripts and at least one more must have lain for
centuries in the monasteries of France or Germany‚ where it is to be
presumed they found some readers, though few if any traces of them are
to be met with in the voluminous literature of the middle ages. My
friend the librarian of our university with his usual readiness to impart
the results of his great reading sent me some time ago a reference to
Honorius of Autun in the bibliotheca maxima patrum xx p. 1001, who
is there made to quote 11 888 in this way, Ea: insensilibus me credas
sensile yiyni ‚· but the context proves that he meant to say ne, not me.

take the· line from the poem itself ἲ Priscian inst. 1v 27 cites it with-
