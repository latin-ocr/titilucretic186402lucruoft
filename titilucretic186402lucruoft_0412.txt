debet: he proceeds to describe at length two kinds: above 26 31 and
33 he had described what ἐρυσίπελας Graeci nominant3 so that if the
latter correspond to our erysipelaS, the sacer iynis must be different:
Celsus by sacer iqnis appears to understand one kind of the ἔρπης of the
Greek physicians 3 others certainly make it to be erysipelas, as Isidor.

eruption of Aetna: illo tempore aiunt tunc plurima fuisse tonitrua et
fulmina quae concursu aridorum corporum facta sunt, non nubium quas

verisimile est in tanto fervore aeris nullas fuisse. 671 coortu: this
word, which occurs 11 1106, 13 3130 Lucretian. 672 tetulerunt: this

under it, full of wind which heats first itself and then the rocks and
earth with which it comes in contact‚ and then bursts out with flame
