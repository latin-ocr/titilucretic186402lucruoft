phys. 11 8 and his commentators Themistius and Simplicius assail it.

of adj ectives like in meaning, eet-pers etc. 3 though 11 843 he has secreta te-
poris: it is possible that the εὔνιδες ὤμων of Empedocles 233, whom he
here imitates, may have suggested the genitive. 840 841 here too
Lucr. seems to be imitating the manner of EmpedocleS, while differing
entirely in the matter: 232 'Hc πολλαὶ μὲν κόρσαι ἀναύχενες ἐβλάστησαν.
Γυμνοὶ δ’ ἐπλάζοντο βραχίονες εὔνιδες ὤμων, Ὅμματά τ’ οἶα πλανᾶτο πενητεύ-
οντα μετώπωνε such a wandel-ing about of single organs and limbs and
their subsequent union Lucr. would ‘have thought absurd3 for Empedocles

quiddam confirmat. primo membra sinqula ex terra quasi praeynate pas-

v. 3once only too, 1v 741 equi atque, he elides an iambus: both these licences
are far commoner in Virgil. Τ116 elision at the end of a v. is absolutely
unknown to Homer: indeed οὐκ οἶδ’ 111 an epigram of Callimachus seems
the only certain instance in Greek hexameter verse. Whoever, Greek
or Latin, introduced the practice, must have done it through misappre-
hending Homer 3 for surely his verse is a dactylic hexam. catal. 850

lent sense: IV 1114 M embra voluptatis dum vi labefacta liquescunt.
853 habere cet. i. e. videmus debere habere utrumque cet.t uterque is in
the dependent clause according to a favourite habit of Lucu: see n. to 1

855—8'7'7 : many races of regularly organised creatures must have
died off, because they wanted either some natural power by which to
protect themselves, or could not be turned to use by man and be saved
thereby: these fell a prey to others and disappeared, unable to endure
the struggle for existence. 855 animantum are opposed to the mon-
strous abortions last spoken of: it was not a natural unfitness for life,
but outward circumstances that prevented their continuance. Granting
Lucretius the premisses from which he starts, his subsequent deductions
are eminently able and logical. 856 propaqanda 850 prfipayando:
