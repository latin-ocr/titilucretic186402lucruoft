room for further flight. Bentl. in 970 for Ultimus proposed Nuntius
, without necessity 3 but he rightly saw, as Wak. observes, that this illus-
tration was suggested to Lucr. by the Roman mode of declaring war: in
the words of Livy 1 32 12 fieri solitum ut fetialis hastam. . adfines eorum
fhrret...hastam in fines eorum emittebat. But you cannot go out of the
omne to fling a spear into a neighbour's bounds. A similar dilemma is
said to have been used by Archytas to prove the infinity of body: go to
the extremity of heaven and try to put out your hand or staff ε you can
or cannot: and so on. In very similar language too Locke essay 11 13
21 seeks to prove space infinite: he asks ‘ whether if god placed a man
at the extremity of corporeal beings, he could not stretch his hand be-
yond his body: if he could, then he would put his arm where there was
before space without bodyt. .if he could not stretch out 1113 116οᾱ, it

must be because of some external hindrance...and then I ask whether
that which hinders his hand from moving onwards be substance or acci-
dent, something or nothing'.

984 (998)-987 (1001); 116 concludes his argument on the omne
with a short statement taken from what 001063 under the sight of all:
comp. what is said above on 701 foll. 759 foll. 915 f011.: comp. too·
11 471—477, 111 367—369‚ v 506—508, 556—563‚ 646—649. That
these vss. shoul'd be placed here admits I think of no question: they
utterly destroy the sequence of the reasoning‚ where they come in mss·
For a probable explanation of why they got out of place see above p. 22 ε
ignorance of the different stages of the argument would suggest that
Postremo must follow Praeterea of 988 ε and therefore the first editor
would not unnaturally give to this addition of the poet’s the place it
has in all mss. All finite things bound and are bounded by something
discontinuous and distinct in kind: comp. the stoic Oleomedes de meteor.

988 (984)-1007: but space or void is likewise infinite ; else matter
during past eternity must have sunk in a mass to the bottom, and
nothing could exist: but as space is infinite on all hands, there is no
lowest point to which first-beginnings can tend: they have boundless
room to move in for ever.—Having shewn the omne to be infinite, he
now proceeds to decide one of the two questions mooted above 953 foll.

and to prove space to be infinite. 988 (984) summai totius is another
