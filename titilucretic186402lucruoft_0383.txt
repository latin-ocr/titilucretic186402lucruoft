of the gods are true, even> that of their immortality: it is only the
mental inferences added to these impressions which are false, that of
their power and strength and providence. 1177 Et tamen: comp.
1125 and n. to 1 1050: ‘ putting all the previous considerations aside,
this that': Cic. de sen. 16 supplies a good instance of this force, notum
enim vobis carmen es& et tam-en ipsius Appii extat oratio i. e. and even
if the verses of Ennius were not known to you, yet Appius' own
speech is extant to inform you. I am astonished that the latest editor
Halm says to et tamen of all mss. ‘malim etiam? 1178 convinci:
he has often used vinco for convinco3 here he uses convinci for vinci3
and I can find no second instance. putabant, 1179 putabant, 1181
videbant, 1176 manebat, 1170 videbant: this monotony of terminations
is common in the older poets who were more unconcerned about such
points than the later. 1180 mortis timor which Lucr. and Epicurus
so often insist on as the main cause of man's misery. vexaret: the subj.
of course expresses their thought. 1183 caeli rationes cet.: Sextus

πρῶτον. 1187 tradere, facere zaceus. subst.: see n. to 1 418. 1188
deum templa seems here to have much the same force as 948 silves·-
tria templa Nympharum. 1189 ἠοω οὐ luna, Luna dies et nox et
noctis siyna: Lach. to support his weak alteration says ‘si poeta in
utroque ἐπανάληψιν voluisset, debebat scribere nox et lana, N οω et
luna, dies3 quibus non poterat subici . . et noctis siyna’ 3 but it was
probably in order that he might add et noctis that he has made this vari-
ation3 and though Lach. says debebat scribere, the poet thought differ-
ently, supported as he was by the authority of the great exemplar of
all poebs, Who says Il. B 837 Τῶν αὖθ’ εΥρτοικίδης ἦρχ’ ’'Ao-tos, ὄρχαμος

1194—1240: what misery men brought on themselves by assigning
to the gods such powers and passions! the ceremonies of superstition
