292 NorEs 11

Cicero that the ship of 387 foll. and the bent oar of 438 were also stock
illustrations in the schools: Macrob. sat. VII 14 enumerates others as
well as these. 468 ab se = ipse : 465 addimus ipsi : nearly the same
is its force 111 271 initum motus ab se quae dividit ollis3 Plaut. miles
940 dat nunc ab se mulier operam 3 and a se fecit in an inscr. Zell. epigr.

469—521 ε if a man teaches that nothing can be known, how does
he know that? how distinguish between knowing and not knowing? on
the truth of the senses all reasoning depends, which must be false if
they are false: nor is one sense more certain than another3 all being
equally true 3 nor is the same sense at one time more certain than at
another: all reasoning‚ nay life itself would at once come to an end, if
the senses are not to be trusted: as in any building‚ if the rule and
square are wry, every part will be crooked and unstable‚ so all reasoning
must be false, if the senses on which it is grounded are false. 469
nil sciri cet. alludes no doubt to the aeademical philosophy which as
said in Cic. acad. pr. 11 61 confundit vera cum falsis, spoliat nos iudicio,
privat adprobatione, omnibus orbat sensibus ε comp. too Macrob. sat. vn
14 20 where the preceding illustratione of Lucr. are alluded to, quae
academicis damnandorum sensuum occasionem dederunt. But in Cic. l. l.
75 it 18 also said of Chrysippus qui fulcire putatur porticum stoicorum,
quam multa ille contra sensus cet. so that Lucr. may well be alluding to
1118 paradoxes‚ id quoque nescit cet.: Metrodorus of Chios a great ad-
mirer of Democritus pushed the paradox to this extreme ε Cic. L 1. 73
says of him initio libri qui est de natwra ‘ neyo’ inquit ‘ scire nos scia-
musne aliquid an nihil sciamus, ne id ipsum quidem, nescire aut scire,
scire nos, nec omnino sitne aliquid an nihil sit’: the original 18 quoted
by Sextus and Eusebius. 4¹71 mittam=omittam: 111 961 mitte,
VI 1056 mirari mitte. contendere causam 18 not easy to explain 3 it ap-
pears to have nothing to do with the technical intendere litem of 111
950 z Lamb. compares Cic. in Catil. 11 25 causas ipsas, quae inter se con-
fliqunt‚ contendere 3 but there contendere is simply to compare together,
as in pro Sex. Rosc. 93: a sense quite unsuitable here ε Gronov. obs. 111
19 compares it with cernere vitam, cernere bellum, puqnare puqnaan and
the like3 and this is probably right: it will therefore = contendere et
agere causam. causans for causam would be an easy emendation. 4¹72
Qui capite cet. appears to be a proverb 3 but its precise force is not very
clear: Gronov. 1.1. explains it by ‘ qui sibi non constat, qui se ipse
evertit, qui cernuat’: this would suit the context3 but a man who tum-
bles on his head, does not place his head where his feet were. Perhaps
by a man putting his head where his feet should be 18 meant that he
assumes as his premiss that nothing can be known, which is the con-
clusion that ought to be, but cannot be proved by such a premiss ι the
