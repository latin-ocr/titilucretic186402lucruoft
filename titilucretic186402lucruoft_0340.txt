322 NOTES II

again Cicero says indifferently esse in loeo, in numero, or loco, numero
parentis3 esse aliquo or in aliquo, nullo or in nullo ¹numero 3 and this
sense easily shades off into the other 3 and Lactant. inst. 111 14 quotes
the v. and paraphrases it thus ‘ qui tamen ob id ipsum deberet pro deo
haberi, quod scopere invenerit: he strangely supposes Lucr. is praising
Thales or Pythagoras. diynarier Ι take to be pass. according 130 13116
usage of Cicero and the older writers diy. esse seems an unusual con-
str„ the simple abl. generally following : so 65 consistere etc. z the infin.
is not usual after ratio reddunda, but a gen. or a prepos. or a dependent
clause, as 67 foll. 53 de divis : ‘ quippe qui libros singulares scripsit
περὶ θεῶν 613 περὶ ὄσιότητος’ Bentl.: Velleius l. 1. solus enim vidit, primum
esse deos. 54 pandere : 1 55 rerum primordia pandam: 126 rerum

55—90: following in his steps Ι teach the inexorable laws by which
all things are bound: having proved the soul to be mortal. and shewn
how images in sleep cheat the mind, I go on to prove the world to be
mortal and to have had a beginning, and to describe how all its parts
were formed 3 what ereatures sprang from the earth, what never ex-
isted 3 how fear of the gods fell upon men: the natural courses too of
the heavenly bodies Ι will explain, that men may not fancy they are
directed by the gods and be enslaved by religion. 58 N ec valeant
i. e. quamque non valeant: but perhaps N ec rather connects what fol-
lows with what precedes in the way illustrated in n. to 1 718. validas
valeant: see n. to 1 826 sonitu sonanti. 59 reperta est i. e. in 111.

uti videamur eos cet, : as far as the general theory of images is con-
cerned, this point can form but a very small part of it3 but morally
speaking, to an epicurean it is the most important of all, as the great
end of physics is to free men from religion and the sear of death: hence
the earnestness with which Lucr. insists upon it. 63 quem vita reli-
quit is the same as qui vitam reliquit: thus 116 says both eum mortis
letique potitum and quem mors et terra potita est: Aen. VI 735 supremo
cum lumine vita reliquit. 64 Quod superest begins the apodosis of
the sentence which commenced at 55. 65--81 : he here enumerates
most of the subjects treated of in this book, which do not however all
follow in the order observed in this summary. 65 66 these questions
