inest deorsum ducere. in se est Flor. 31 Gamb. also. quantum est in se
deorsum ducere Lach: this I found also in one Vat. ms. 210 caeli
Bern. better than summo 01 aetherio of older editors: caeli I had myself
restored from Cic. Arat. 297 summo caeli de vertice tranans.

Gamb. 101· firme. 219 Incertisque loci spatiis decellere Lach. for Incer-
tisque locis spatio depellere: a brilliant emendation. Possibly Lucr.

by all before Lamb. without sense. 247 se before est added by F lor. 31
Gamb. etc. 249 recta reqione. recta added by Nic. Nicc. whom all
before Lach. rightly followed: it was absorbed by the similar letters in
reqione. nulla regione Lach. 249 Declinare quis est qui possit cernere

252 semper added after emoritur by Nic. Nicc. Flor. 31 all editors

not right, as the new motion does not first begin when the other ceases.
The reason of the omission was the semper of 251. 257 potestas Lach.
101 voluptas: a certain correction: comp. 286. Lamb. in vain trans-
poses voluptas and voluntas of 258. Flor. 31 Camb. have voluptas in
both places, but it can be right in neither. 264 equorum Brix. 101

inque valebunt Ald. 1 J unt. vulg. ‘vix latine' says Lach. 305 extra·
