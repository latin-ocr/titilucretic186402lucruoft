epicureans both Greek and Roman: to one of them, Philodemus as it
now appears from the Herculanean fragments recently published, we
know he was greatly indebted in his de natura deorum. And if Lucre-
tius were quite unknown to him, a word from Atticus or even from
Memmius would have made him undertake what would seem so slight a
task to a man of his laborious and energetic habits. The poem must
have been given to the world exactly as it was left by the author, with
nothing added or taken from it to all appearance. If Cicero then was
editor, he probably put it into the hands of some of his own amanuenses
or entrusted it to the large copying establishment of Atticus 3 and he
may have spent only a few hours in looking over it or hearing it read to
him: his name rather than his time was probably wanted by the friends
of Lucretius. All this would of course be the idlest guess-work, if it
were not for the express statement of J erome, that is of Suetonius, that
he was editor 3 a statement which is in some measure confirmed by the
younger Pliny epist. 111 15 who thus writes to his friend Proculus,
Petis ‘ab libellos tuos iri secessu Zeyam examinemque an editione sirit diqni,
adhibes preces, adleqas eoeemplum‚· r09as etiam ut aliquid subsecivi tem-
poris studiis meis subtraham, impertiam tuis .· adici-s· M. Tullium mira
benignitate poetarum inyenia fovisse. The exemplum in question may
well have been the poem of Lucretius. Professor Sellar Roman poets of
the republic p. 203 though not inclined to admit the editorship of
Cicero, yet argues that J erome must be speaking of Marcus.

However this may be, it is certain enough that the poem was given
to the world early in the year 700, and in the unfinished state in which it
was left by the author: indeed I hardly like to say how strong my
suspicions, even my convictions are, that many of the most manifest
blunders in the poem as we now have it, appeared in the very first
edition of it whether from design or inadvertency. It is not easy in
any other way to explain the agreement of Macrobius and Nonius with
the archetype of all existing manuscripts in many indisputable corrup-
tions. The story of his madness has been examined by Prof. Sellar
1. l. p. 200. Whether there is any truth in it or not, it cannot be
doubted that it was already current in Suetonius' time 3 yet few will
’deny ‘that it would be strange if so remarkable a poem had been
written in the lucid intervals of insanity.’ This poem was designed to
be a complete exposition of the physic-al system of EpicuruS, not for the
sake of the system itself, but in order to free the minds of men from
the two greatest of all ills, fear of death and sear of the gods, by ex-
plaining to them the true nature of things. 80 far he followed in the
steps of his master who with the same end in view composed among
many other works one entitled περὶ φύσεως 111 37 books, of which
some wretchedly scanty and incomplete fragments have been published
