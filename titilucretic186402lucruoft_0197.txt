such for the sake of argument, yet that which is affirmed will still
follow, or that which is denied will still not follow: the reasoning there-
fore is, granting for the moment space to be finite, yet none the less the
general conclusion will be true that the omne is infinite 3 it therefore in-
troduces another proof of this fact 3 and has nothing to do with proving
space to be infinite: the demonstration of that begins at 988 (984):

cet. 3 v 195 Quod si iam rerum iqnorem primordia quae sint, Hoc tamen
cet.: also 1 396 with imperf. Nee, si iam posset, sine inani posset3 and
111 766 with indic. quod si iam fit, fateare necessest 3 and 843 si iam nos-
tro sentit cet: 666 6160 1V 1171 Sed tamen esto iam. For this use of si
iam and a similar one of ut iam in Cicero and iam ut in Livy and
Caesar see Madv. de fin. p. 589: Tusc. disp. 1 50 si ia‘m¹ possent, not 16-
ferred to by him, is a good instance. 970 Ultimus is added to give
force and point to extr. oras: it appears to be proleptic ε 116 111116 forward
to the outmost edge, so as then to be standing on its farthest point:

has officiant nihil nihilque inpediant quominus. 978 fini is in the
mark or limit aimed at : Lucr. has many such ablativeS, colli tussi orbi

from the limit of the omne: in the former case body 1166 stopped it, and
this body must be in the universe3 in the latter space 1166 afforded it
room to fly on. Notice finis thrice within three lines in three senses:

too the use of fiat in one sense seems actually to suggest to him Fiet uti
