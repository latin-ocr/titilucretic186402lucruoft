the Memmii in Oohen’s medailles consul. and esp. Mommsen’s Roem.

Muenzw. p. 597: it will be seen that Venus crowned by Cupid appears

on the coins of this Memmius and apparently his elder brother Lucius!
You come to the flatterers of the J ulii before you find so large a propor-
tion of the coins of any family with Venus on them. We know from
virgil, who is said to have taken it from the Punic war of Naevius, that
the Memmii claimed descent from the Trojan Mnestheus. In Aen. XII
Mnestheus is called Assaraci yertus. The Memmii may have claimed
Venus for ancestress, though Virgil reserved that honour for the J ulii.
At all events Venus must have been held in peculiar honour by them 3
and Lucr. may have wished to gratify his patron, by making her his
own patron lady. Oohen says p. 112 ‘Hercules and Venus were the ob-
jects of the peculiar veneration of Sulla3 therefore we see the head of
Venus on nos. 49 and 50, and that of Venus on 51'. Now Oohen men-
tions two other coins of the Memmii which have a head of Hercules 3
and Mommsen p. 642 describes two struck by the son of our Memmius,
one with a head of Ceres, in honour of his father 3 the other in honour of

’ a remoter ancestor, with a Ceres and the legend MEMMIUS· AED· CERIALIA·
PREIMUS· FECIT. At the opening of book v Ceres is spoken of and a long
enumeration made of the deeds of Hercules, which are shewn to be far
inferior to those of Epicurus. In the beg. of VI the discovery of corn is
recorded, but declared far inferior to that of philosophy by Epicurus.
Did Lucr. mean to say ‘You pride yourself, MemmiuS, on your family
connexion with Hercules and Ceres 3 but let me tell you you had better
learn to be proud of the philosopher’l Many of these motives may have
weighed with Lucr. and his poetica] instinct carried him beyond his first
intention. Let me here refer to Prof. Sellar’s Roman poets of the re-
public p. 276 foll.

50—61 he calls on Memmius to attend, while he explains the ‘nature
of the first elements of things. 50 Lach. has rightly seen, as I have said
in notes l, that the interpolated verses have thrust out the protasis of
this sentence, in which Memmius must have been addressed 3 unless the
Verona interpr. Verg. misquotes and refers to IV 912 tenuis aures
animumque sayacem 3 which is not probable: the omission of part of
the v. in A B suggests a still greater disturbance. Quod superest a fau
vourite expression of Lucr. for ‘to proceed to what remains' ‘moreover' 3
and often put in the middle of a sentence at the beg. of the apodosis,
as here: compare 11 39, 491, vl 1000 etc.: see also 11 546 and 1v 205,
where it is in another part of the sentence: perhaps Aen. lx 157 is
likewise a case in point. vacuas auris is well illustrated by Quintil.
inst. x 1 32 Neque illa Sallustiana brevitas qua nihil apud aures vacuas
atque eruditas potest esse perfectius, apud occupatum variis coqitationibus
