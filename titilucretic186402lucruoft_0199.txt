ferna: it is true that according to Lucr. there is no lowest point in
space ς and perhaps he and Epic. would have said that up and down
were mere relative terms. But his conception of atoms implied, as we
shall see in 11, their racing through space at an enormous uniform speed
in parallel right lines in one direction, with the curicus exception ex-
plained 11 216 foll. This inherent motion both Epicurus and Lucr.
understand as a motion downwards: they had no other conception of
downwards in space. When by the artifice spoken of atonis were en-
abled to clash and. combine, both Epicurus and Lucr. conceived the
rising up of atonis 111 a direction more or less contrary to the only na-
tural motion as that which enabled things to come into being and
remain in being, and rendered possible the existence and maintenance of
the summa rerum. It is utterly vain for Lach. to attempt 130 controvert

the other question proposed above: for space being infinite, if matter
were finite, then nothing in being could exist one moment: this world
for example and al] its parts would dissolve into their atoms; or rather
could never have existed, for it is only by au infinite supply of matter
that this earth and heaven can be maintained: the mutual clashings of
.atoms might keep this world, or any other world, supplied for a time ,·
but only for a time: nay without infinite matter, even these clashings
