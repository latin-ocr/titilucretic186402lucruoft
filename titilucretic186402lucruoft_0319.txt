the thing spoken of and something else: in all these cases intus in pretty
nearly gives the force of in ipso. '738 quae confiunt: V 890 Ne forte
em homine et veterino semine equorum Confieri credas Centauros posse.
'739 Nam certe cet.: Cic. de nat. deor. 1 108 uses this as an argument to
overthrow the theory in question: quid, quod earum rerum quae num-
quam omnino fuerunt neque esse potuerunt, ut Scyllae, ut Chimaerae 2
736—739 obs. fhtnt, confiunt, faeta, fit. 7 41 equi atque: Lach. in his
most elaborate 11. to 111 954 goes through the whole range of Latin
poetry to determine who can and who cannot thus elide the last syll. of
an iambus 3 and this liberty 116 peremptorily refuses to Lucr. I am not
convinced: his contemporary Cicero whose principles of versification
much resemble his own, could write retro ad, leo et, his contemporary
Catullus ioco atque, ave atque. But Lucr. had he thus elided once, must
surely it may be said have done so more than once: yet he once and
only once, V 849 debere, has a hypermetrical verse 3 twice and twice only
he lengthens a short syll. by the caesura, 11 27 fulyet auroque, v 1049
sciret animoque 3 and twice by caesura leaves a long vowel long and un-
elided, 111 374 animae elementa, vl 'a' 55 loci ope 3 though in five of these
six cases Lach. tampers with the text. '742 H aereseit ε 11 477 haeres-
cere: lexicons give no other instances of the word. ante i. 6. 726.
746 prius 1.6. 17 61011. '747 Quaelibet una, and therefore even the
most incongruous assemblage of things, if they have for the instant
formed into one image. 748 ipsa, as well as the images.

749—776: so far as what the mind sees resembles what the eye
sees, their causes must be like: now the lion we see in mind is the same
we 866 with the eyes, both therefore are seen by images: and thus in
sleep we see, for instance one who is dead, by images coming to the
mind, the senses and memory being then inactive and not able to
detect the absurdity: again images move as we see them in sleep‚ merely
because some are coming others going every instant, so that they appear
to be the same in different postures. '752 Nune iyitur: 111 203 and
434 Nunc iyitu‘r quoniam: the particles imply that having established a
principle, he now proceeds to apply it. docui quoniam: Aen. v 22
superat quoniam fortuna, sequamur. ‘ Lambinus recte dedit quoniam
docui, ut in 111 203 Nune iyitur quoniamst animi natura ‘reperta’ Lach.:
an illustration not at all to the point: neither there nor in 434 could he
have changed the place of quoniam: he has here written docui quoniam

probably for the pleasanter sound: comp. 11 547 and 11. there. '754
