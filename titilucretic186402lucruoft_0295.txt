BOOK 1v 277

10'76—1094: again why such a craving for life mid troubles and
dangers‘l death cannot be shunned: no nor does length of life create
any new pleasure 3 while the future may bring evil as well as good for-
tune 3 and live as long as we may, the eternity of death will ever be the
same. 1076 in dub. periclis, as 55. 1079 pote is a neut. adj. and
est is om. as in suave, nec mirum, quid mirum: see 11. to 11 1 and 5 :
v 836 Quod pote, fuit is om. : pote is thus used by the best writers.
1081 procuditur: see n. to 11 1115. 1082 like 957 Sed quia semper
aves quod abest, praesentia temnis. 1084 hiantis, keeping up the
metaphor of sitis. 1085 has a proverbial smack, as Virg. geor. Ι 461
quid vesper serus vehat: Gell. xm 11 lepidissimus liber est M. Varronis
em satiris Menippeis qui inscribitur nescis quid vesper serus vehat.
1087 Nee prorsum : see n. to Ι 748. 1090 condere saecla: Hor. od.
IV 5 29 Condit quisque diem3 Plin. epist. IX 36 4 quamquam lonyis-
simus dies cito conditur 3 Virg. ecl. IX 52 Zonyos . . cantando condere
soles, where Conington says condere to bury, for to see go down, and he
and Heyne compare Gallim. epigr. 11 3 Ἠέλιον λέσχῃ κατεδύσαμενε but
such a use is better suited to sol or dies, than saecla 3 and it seems likely
that Lucr. was thinking rather of the technical condere lustrum, though
what the exact force of that expression is or how far it differs from
facere lustrum, I cannot tell: yet Livy 1 44 2 says idque eonditum lus-
trum appellatum, quia is censendo finis faetus est, and Hor. od. ΙΙ 4 24
claudere lustrum 3 so that the word must have suggested to them the

notion of closing and completing. 1091 M ors aeterna: 869 mors
inmortalis.

BOOK IV

1—25=1 926-950, except 11 Nam, Ι 936 Sed3 24 percipi3‚ 1 949
perspicis 3 25 ac persentis utilitatem, 1 950 qua constet compta fiqura: see
Lachmann’s explanation of this last variation in notes 1 to 44—47 3 yet
I do not think that Lucr. who like other early writers repeats words
and phrases with such indifference‚ would have hesitated as to a single
word compta with an interval of two vss. τ the fact is qua constet compta
fiqura would have been here utterly out of place, because what he says
about the fiqura of the universe is said between 1 950 and the end of 11.

25 persentis: 111 249 he uses persentiscunt3 but Virg. Aen. IV 448 also
has persentit.

26—41 : having explained the nature of the soul, I now go on to an
important question that of idols or images, which like small films con-
stantly proceed from the surface of all things and float in the air, and
