ratione: 1070 quando omnia constant, or with Lach. ubi summa pro-
fundi-st: 1072 eam mayis ob rem.- 1073 repelli. 1073 Lach. reads alio
for alia, and proposes meare at end, and malle putari in 1072: he
declines to prophesy in 1068 and 1069. 1071 J unt. most truly neque
omnino si iam medium sit for denique omniuo si iam. 1074: end is
supplied in Ald. 1 and J unt. 1075 debet Wak. oportet older corr.
1076 aeque J unt. for aequis which Wak. absurdly defends. 1078 iu
added by Ald. 1 J unt. 1082 concilio J unt. for conci-lium, the m coming
from. mcclii. concilium...vectae Lach. which seems less poetical. vinctae
Bentl.

· 1085 1086 are transposed in J unt. followed by all before Lach.: there
is certainly an awkwardness at present: perhaps one is a subsequent
addition by the poet 3 see above p. 22. 1091 se ibi Wak. Lach. for sibi.
1094-1101: A has faithfully left a blankv space for these eight lost
verses. They came at the beginning of p. 46 of the lost archetype 3 the
eight mutilated lines above having headed the page on the other side of
the leaf. Lach. therefore most justly concludes that this part of the 1631
111 1116 original of our mss. was by some accident torn away. Both the old
ms. collations of A and B which 1 possess mention this lacuna: N. Hein-
sius says ‘in A octo versuum hiatus erat relictus’. The less careful 18.
Vossius, though the manuscript was his own, merely says ‘vide ms. in
quo hiatus post haec verba'. Think now of Havercamp‚ a Professor
in the University where A and B then were, never noting this fact,
but inserting the miserable makeshift verse of the J unt. Terra det.- at
supra circum teyere omnia caelum ,· stealing the critical note of the
London bookseller’s edition, and noting that this spurious verse was not
in B, from which every reader must infer it was in A. I formerly made
the following verses to shew the general sense of those which are lost:
Daedala sufficiat rerum natura creatrice, Scilicet incerto diversi errore
vaqantes Arqume‘nta sibi prorsum puyriantia finyuoit. Quae tam-eri om-
nia sunt falsa ratione recepta. Nam quoniam cloeui spatium siue fine
‘modoque Immensumque patere iri cunctas undique partis, Sic parili
ratione necessest suppeditetur Infinita etiam vis undique materiai, Ne
cet. 1105 penetralia Nic. Nice. for tonetralia; rightly followed by all
the old printed eds. (not by the 11188.) before Lamb. who reads tonitra-
lia: neither tonetralia nor tonitralia is Latin. 1108 abeat Ed. after
J unt. for abeant Wrongly adapted to the adjacent plural: com. VI 286:
omnis agrees with terra.- comp. VI 605 sqq. Lach. in 1106 reads omnia,
as also 11 719 without authority.

1114 sei Ed. after Nic. N icc. Flor. 31 031111). etc. for sie: a verse is
here lost which 1 feel sure was of this kind, Cetera iam poteris per te
tute ipse videre, with which the preceding words parva perduct-us opella
must be joined. Lucr. says it is hard to master his principles, but when
that is thoroughly done, then led on with little trouble you may learn
the rest yourself. Oomp. especially 1 400—417, and see Camb. J ourn.
of phil. 1 p. 374. Lach. for sic reads scio and perdoctus for perductus,
and then gets'no satisfactory sense: J unt. reads uon for ‘nec in 1115:
Lamb. perfunctus for perdoctus.- Bern. si3, and perdoctus after Lach.
