great multitude of particular instances, he has chosen to abandon the
sase ground of evidence and experience and has made Virgil write what
110 decided on a priori principles he must have written. This seems to
me the reason why his system was not more generally followed. Still
less satisfactory was Madvig's spelling in his de finibus published in
1839: it was utterly unlike that of the mss. and y'et in many points it
was not what Cicero used 3 in still more you could not be sure whether
it was what he used or not. Here too Lachmann bringing into play his
extraordinary ‘power of asking the right question’, and joining with
it a minute knowledge of the whole evidence upon the subject, saw at
once what could be attained and what could not, and shaped his course
accordingly. The Leyden mss. of LucretiUS, imperfect in many respectS,
are on the whole admirable in their orthography‚ at least equa] to any
of the mss. of Virgil, confirming them in what is true and confirmed
by them in turn: in some nice points, such as the frequent retention of
the enclitic st, they far surpass them. With their aid he was able to
confirm those improvements in spelling which Wagner had so well
established in opposition to the system in common use. But in regard
to the other class of words in which the usage of the ancients varied in
different ages or even in the same age, 110 did not dogmatically deter-
mine what his author wrote and thus close the door to all future
change3 but knowing that certainty was not here attainable, he care-
fully sifted the evidence offered by his mss. and made the best approxi-
mation 110 0011101 to what his author might have written, always taking
the most ancient form for which his authorities supplied any testimony
direct or indirect. Thus the question was not foreclosed 3 nor were we
left to vague generalities, but a firm historical groundwork was gained
upon which future improvements might be built, if better evidence
hereafter offered itself. Lachmann then in this, as in so many other
departments of philology‚ seems at once to have produced conviction in
the minds of the majority of the most thoughtful schol-ars, in Germany
I mean; for in our own country most seem to scout the question as
unworthy of serious attention: a great mistake 3 for Latin orthography
is a most interesting and valuable study to those who care to examine
it, and touches in a thousand points the history grammar and pronun-
ciation of the language. Let me give two examples of the effect at
once produced by Lachmann. Otto Jahn in 1843 published his ela-
borate edition of Persius in which he adopted throughout the spelling
then in common use, though 110 had so many excellent mss. to guide
him to a better course: in 1851, the year after Lachmann’s work came
out, he published the text of his J uvenal— and followed in it most
minutely the principles of Lachmann3 and fortunately he had a most
excellent authority in the codex Pithoeanus 3 so that the spelling is
probably not very far removed from.the author’s own. In the years
just preceding Lachmann Halm published several orations of Cicero
with elaborate critical Latin notes 3 and yet, though his spelling was “
somewhat better than that of J ahn's Persius, it is still essentially ‘ con-
ventional' and arbitrary: in the years following Lachmann he published
a series of school editions of Cicero's orations with brief German notes,
and yet in these the spelling was wholly modelled 011 the system
