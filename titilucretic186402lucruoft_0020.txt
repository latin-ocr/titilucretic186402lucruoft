2 NOTES I

nasci instead of yiyni. It would not appear then to be borrowed from
him, unless the editor of the bibliotheca has thought fit tacitly to
substitute qiqni from Lucretius. I have glanced through the not very
voluminous works of this father, but find no other allusion to our poet 3
nor is he once quoted by John of Salisbury the greatest classica] scholar
of that age. Years ago on reading through the highly finished poem of
J oseph of Exeter de bello Troiano, who lived in the same century, Ι
noticed several expressions which at the time struck me as Lucretian ,-
but on further consideration this appeared to be more than doubtful.

In Italy he was even more completely unknown. A catalogue
which Muratori antiq. 111 p. 820 assigns to the tenth century, proves
that the famous librar-y of Bobbio contained at that time librum
Lucretii 13 but before the fifteenth no Italian poet or writer shews any
knowledge of him whatever. In the year 1414 the celebrated Poggio
Bracciolini went as apostolic secretary to the council of Constance and
remained on this side the Alps in different countries, Switzerland
Germany France and England, until 1420. During these years he
procured from various monasteries many most important Latin worlts
hitherto totally unknown in Italy: see Mehus’ preface to his life of
Ambrosius Traversarius p. xxxiii foll. Among these was a manuscript
of Lucretius, obtained apparently from some German monastery either
by him or his companion Bartholomew of Montepulciano in 1417 as his
letters seem to indicate, and transmitted the same year to his intimate
friend the Florentine Nicolo Niccoli, a most zealous scholar and patron
of the revived classical studies. This manuscript which Poggio wrongly
supposed to be only a part of the poem, has itself disappeared, but was
the parent of every copy written during the 15th century, that is to
say of every one now extant with the exception of those specified
above: it must have very closely resembled the Leyden folio. ‘Et te,
Lucreti, longo post tempore tandem Civibus et patriae, reddit habere
suae’ says Landinus in his poem in praise of Poggio. N iccoli having
such a treasure in his hands was in no hurry to part with it. We find
Poggio writing to him many years aster to remind him that he had
kept his Lucretius twelve years. Soon after it is ‘you have had
Lucretius now for fourteen years ; I want to read him, but cannot get
him3 do you wish to keep him another ten years? Then he tries
what coaxing will do: ‘if you will send Lucretius, I shall be very much
obliged3 and promise not to keep the book more than a single month’.
Much as Niccoli loved PoggiO, he loved still more to have the sole
possession of a newly discovered Latin poet, and Ι doubt whether
Poggio saw his Lucretius at all events before his return from Rome to
Florence in 1434. Niccoli died in 1437 and left behind him a manu-
script written by his own hand and now in the Laurentian library, the
truest representative of Poggio's lost original, as is abundantly proved
by the critical notes of the present edition. Between this date and that
of the earliest printed editions a knowledge of the poem was diffused
through Italy by many incorrect copies. Eight of these, including
Niccoli’s, are preserved in the Laurentian library, all of which I have
eramined, two with care, as being of no small importance for the text 3
six are in the Vatican, all seen by me as long ago as the autumn of
