10 NOTES I

when it first appears in J unt, Ι still say J unt, though it is always to be
inferred that the best readings are most likely due to Marullus. By
assigning to him all of these one would often be doing him less, some-
times more than justice. ·

The J untine closes the first great epoch of improvement m the text
of Lucretius: the second Aldine edited by the well-known scholar An-
drew Naugerius and dated ‘ mense ianuario M.D.XV.’ is for the most part
a mere reprint of it without however one word of acknowledgment ac-
cording to the usage of the time. Yet the changes are not few, mostly
for the better, not always ε two instances are given above from the first
page, the one a gross corruption, the other a right rejection of an inter-
polation. For the next fifty years Ald. 2 appears to have been the
model edition. Gryphius of Lyons published several texts, three of
which I have before me: they generally follow Naugerius, but not al-
ways, often recurring to Avancius. Those of 1534 and 1540 have many
marginal readings, most of them taken from Avancius. or the notes of
Pius, a few from sources not known to me: see notes 1 to Ι 977 offici-
atque. Yet even these two editions do not always agree with each
other.

Little advance however was made on the J untine before Dionysius
Lambinus. He dates his address to Oharles IX 1 November 1563 and
afterwards speaks of his first edition as published in that year3 though
the title-page of my copy has 1564. Lambinus was among the most
illustrious of the great Latin scholars who studied and taught at Paris
111 the fifteenth century. His knowledge of Cicero and the older Latin
writers as well as the Augustan poets has never been surpassed and

, rarely equalled. Whoever doubts that the nicest critical and gramma-

tical questions 0811 be expressed in Ciceronian Latin without effort or
affectation, let him study the commentaries of Lambinus. Truly does
Scaliger say of him ‘Latine et Romane loquebatur optimeque scribebat' :
his ease and readiness fare astonishing. He made use he tells us of five
mss: four of these appear to have been Italian mss. of the fifteenth
century: the fifth, of which he used a collation by Turnebus and which
he calls the Bertinian, was the same as the Leyden quart0. In his
preface and throughout the work he acknowledges his obligations to
Turnebus and Auratus. His Lucretius is perhaps the greatest of his
works: there was more to be done here, and therefore he has done more.
He had moreover a peculiar admiration for this author, of whom in the
preface to his third edition he says ‘omnium poetarum Latinorum qui
hodie exstant et qui ad nostram aetatem pervenerunt elegantissimus 811
purissimus, idemque gravissimus atque ornatissimus Lucretius est'.
Though his boast that he has restored the text in 800 places goes beyond
the truth‚ yet the superiority of his text over all preceding texts can
scarcely be exaggerated 3 for the quickness of his 111118118011 united with
his exquisite knowledge of the language gave him great power in the
field of conjecture, and for nearly three centuries his remained the stand-
ard text. Lachmann says he did far less than Marullus. But 80 far
as there is truth in this, it is merely saying that the one lived before the
other: nine tenths of what Marullus effected‚ Lambinus could have
done currente calam03 but I doubt whether Marullus could have ac·
