ἐστι συγκρίσεις, τὰ δ’ ἐξ ὧν αἱ συγκρίσεις πεποίηνται. 483 corpora 111 its
most general sense, as 420 riam corpora sunt et inane: and as already
observed he always uses the term quite indifferently for either corpora
prima or res. 484 coneilio constant: see n. to 221 : Lucr. has either
the simple abl. after constare in this sense, or adds ex or de: though
Cicero appears never to omit the prepos. ew. 485 Sed means, though
other corpora may, these may not. 486 Stinyuere seems peculiar to
Lucr. who uses it several timeS‚ and his frequent model Cicero in his Ara-
tea: it seems synon. with eaetinyuere and is used elsewhere by Lucr. for
quenching fire or thirst. demum: however long the contest, they in the
end prevail: ἄτομα καὶ ἀμετάβλητα, says Epicurus himself l.l. 489 :

ing up of the whole inner structure of a thing by some greater force,
esp. heat as here: 1v 697 iqui emilabefacta ; Aen. vt11 390 Intravit calor

503—550: where void is, body is not: these first bodies therefore
are solid and without void: things 111 being, all contain pure void en-
closed by pure body: these first bodies then may continue, when the
things are broken up: and void we have shewn must exist 3 it alternates
then with body: these first bodies cannot be crushed split or broken up
from within 3 they are therefore eternal: without this eterna] matter all
things would have come from nothing, and would have been reduced to
nothing: first-beginnings therefore are of solid singleness. 506 eibi
appears to be added merely to increase the force of per se and puram as
in English we say ‘in and for itselfi’ ‘for and by itself’ 3 this being a
cardinal point in Epicurus’ philosophy, the absolute distinctness of the
atoms and void which alternate in everything in being, he puts the
statement of this doctrine in a variety of shapes. The necessary result
is the absolute hardness and impenetrability of his first-beginnings 3 and

it is the absence of this perfect fulness and solidity in the elements of ,Ι

rival philosophers that he again and again most strongly inveighs

against. 509 qua, ea ι Caes. de bello civ. 1 64 3 ea transire flamen,
