iu mundi part. ullis: the gods dwelt in μετακόσμια, which Cicero trans-
lates by intermuuclia: see n. to 111 18 sedesque quietae. 149 animi
mente: see n. to 111 615 : Velleius in Cic. de nat. deor. Ι 48 says hominis
esse specie deos confitendum est. uec tamen ea species corpus est, sed quasi
corpus, uec habet sanquinem, sed quasi sanquinem. . ..Epicurus autem . .
docet eam esse vim et naturam deorum ut primum nou sensu sed mente
cernatur, uec soliditate quadam: again in de div. 11 40 we have the
adversary’s sarcastic description deos euim ipsos iocandi causa induerit
Epicurus perlucidos et perflabilis et habitantis tamquam inter duos lucos
sic iuter duos mundos propter metum ruinarum3 eosque habere putat
eadem membra quae uos, ‘nec usum ullum habere membrorum: but as
Bentley says in his first Boyle lecture ‘if Epicurus and Democritus

were in earnest about their philosophy, they did necessarily and really
believe the existence of the gods’. 150 suffuyit has here the common
force of the Greek aorist. 151 contingere = tangere: 152 Tauqere
cet.: yet though a finer sort of touch, it is, as 116 shews in ΙΙΙ, material
touch by which the mind is affected as well as the body. And grantingv
his premisses, as well as what he next says, that their abodes are as fine
as their bodies, their existence as he argues in 1161 foll. is known to us
only by the images they send to the minds of men : these images
must be much finer than the bodies of the gods which emit them: are
ἢ these images immortali if not, why are these gods, which are much
finer than men and much grosser than their own images, imperishable‘l
a dilemma surely, as they must be intermediate between things alike
perishable: these intermundia too, as shewn in 11. to 111 18, are as nume-
rous as the worlds in space, that 16 to say are innumerable: why are
they all imperishable, while numberless worlds are hourly perishing‘l
why do ‘ some rambling troops of atoms upon the dissolution of a neigh-
bouring world', to use Bentley’s words 1. 1., never come in contact with
151161112 if by their fiueness they elude destruction in this or that place
through countless ages, can they do so in countless different places
through countless ages? but there is no end-to such questions: see the
last chapters of Cic. de nat. deor. 1: the most that can be said is that the
stoical or peripatetical theory of gods is open to as grave objections. 155
Quae tibi cet.: this promise, as already observed, he has nowhere fulfilled.

156 Dicere cet.: again directed against the teleology of stoics and
peripatetics: so the epicurean in Cic. de nat. deor. 1 23 au haec, ut sere
dicitis, homiuum eausa a deo constituta suut? cet. 158 Adlaudabile
