196 NOTEs 11

165—183 ε ‘ they are greatly mistaken who think that the course of
nature could not go on, nor the products of the earth and the race of
men be continued without divine providence: nay I might prove from
the imperfection of this world that it is not divinely created.'— That
these vss. have no proper connexion with what precedes or follows 3 that
184 continues the argument as it was left at 164 3 and that in a finished
composition 183 and 184 could not stand side by side, has been demon-
strated by Lach. He shews with as much certainty as if he had had
the poet’s ms. before him, that 165—183 must have been a subsequent
addition which the author’s death prevented him from adapting to the
context: in this state the first editor must have introduced them into
the body of the poem. Lach. has also proved that v 195—234 which
fulffl the promise of 182, are likewise a subsequent addition 3 as well as
the cognate argument 1v 823—857, where the doctrine of final causes in
respect of the bodily organs is so earnestly denied. On these and similar
sections of the poem see what is said above p. 21 22, where I attempt to
carry Lachmann’s argument somewhat farther. Some vss., as is said in
notes 1, are clearly wanting before 165: whether they ever existed in
the poem and were not rather lost before it came into the first editor's
handS, we may well doubt with Lach. The way in which the latter
supplies the meaning of what is wanting, seems to me however some-
what awkward: I should be disposed to make the gods the subject to
persectari and videant, and to take the reasoning to be something like
that in Cic. de div. 11 105 foll. where it is said ueqant id esse alienum
maiestate deorum. scilicet causas omnium introspicere, ut videant quid
cuique conducat. [You must not suppose that the gods have anything
to do with the motions and unions of these atoms: nay it would not be
even consistent with their majesty and happiness to be tormenting them-
selves with all these minutiae,] ‘and to be following up the course of
every single atom to see how everything goes on.'

165 persectari recurs lv 1010, and appears to be peculiar to Lucr.
167 quidam: the stoics are doubtless pointed at, perhaps also the aca-
demics. 169 admoderate seems also peculiar to Lucr. ι Gronov. observ.
111 5 compares the attemperate of Ter. Andr. 916 which has precisely

the same sense. 171 Et iam cetera appears to be used almost abso· J

lutely, as cetera, et cetera are in so many ways: fieri or ‘naturam facere
uon posse may be understood from the context. 172 173; these two

vss. are connected with the relative clause, as in some of the instances ”

given in n. to 1 718. 172 deducit, metaphor from leading the bride
to her husband: comp. 1 96 Deducta-st and n. there. 1¹73 blanditur
propayent harshly said for blandiendo hortatur ut prop. as Lach. ob-

serves: he compares Vitruv. pref. to ⁵111. 1¹74 quorum i. e. hominum, ⁷
understood from yenus hum: see n. to IV 934. 175 omuibu' rebus is ,,
