177—230: the animus consists of very small round atoms, which
can move with extreme celerity and ease3 for nothing is so swift as
thought: of visible things those which move most easily, as water, are
composed of very small round elements: those of the animus then must
be eminently subtle. Again the fineness and smallness of 1116 311113161166
of the animus and anima are shewn by this: after death, when they
have left the body, it is not perceptibly diminished in size or weight ς
you may compare it with wine whose flavour is gone or the like: the
elements which compose this flavour are very minute 3 and their absence
does not lessen the weight and bulk of the wine. 177 animus: it
will be seen, by comparing 208 eius with 212 animi natura animaeque
and the rest of the Section, that here too he includes 1116 anima in the
term animus 3 though it 13 1101 1111 421 11161 116 16113 113 11161 when he
uses one word he intends to comprise the other as well, where the one is
1101 expressly distinguished from the other. It is his general practice,
as we have often seen, to keep distinct similar words, when his argument
requires it, 10 1136 1116111 indifferently‚ when precision is not called for.
corpore is here used in its most general sense for material substance.
