Ι speak of that given by Professor Sellar in the Roman poets of the
republic.

BOOK I

1—43: the poet calls upon Venus, as mother of the RomanS,
author of their being to all living creatures and sole mistress of the
nature of things, to help him in writing on that theme3 but first to
constrain her lover Mars the lord of war to grant peace to the Romans
in order that he himself might have ease of mind to write, and his friend
Memmius leisure to read what he wrote.

-1 Aen. yenetrix: her peculiar relation to the children of Aeneas is
placed in vivid contrast with that which she bears to 13110 whole of animate
and inanimate nature. Lucr. may have had in his mind Ennius ann.

Lamb. compares meretrix meritus with qenetrix yenitust Lach. adds
yenetivus and obstetrix institor, and attributes the e to the following long

mereto is repeatedly found in old inscriptions3 that meritus therefore,
not meretrix, has changed its vowe13 that obstetrix too is intermediate
between stator and institor: comp. recepit accedere and the like. This
is true3 but authority calls imperiously for 9enetrix, and yenetus
yenetor may once liave been in use: see the index of the new corpus

ffnurse, pleasure‚ Pallas 3 but here it has manifestly a peculiar force with
reference to all that follows in this fine address in which no word is
thrown away. alma Venus was not only familiar to poets, but seems
to have passed into the language of the people. Ι find on the basis
