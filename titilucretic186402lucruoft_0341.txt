this passage and Aen. 1 546 si vescitur aura Aetheria 3 from Pacuvius

praemiis 3 and Cic. de fin. V 57 vesci voluptatibus ι vesci therefore = frui 3
and so 857 quaecumque vides vesci vitalibus auris. '75 lacus, such as
the Ampsancti valles, ‘ i. e. omni parte sancti', as Servius says3 the lake
of Nemi, the ‘ speculum Dianae’ of Aricia 3 the Avernus, Fucinus, Ve-

flectat fortuna qubernans3 which comes to the same thing, as the epi-
curean nature is at one and the same time blind chance and inexorable
necessity: vl 31 Seu casu seu vi, qnod sic natura parasset, where casu
and vi are different expressions for the same thing. 82—90 are word
for word the same as V1 58—66, the last two vss. recurring again and
again: indeed the whole of this paragraph 55-90 in character and
manner much resembles vl 26—89, 1- 54-61, 127—135, IV 26—52
and some others : these are all introductions to what follows and have
an awkward constrained unfinished style about them, as if written
against the grain in order to complete for the time what was wanting.
In our passage of six and thirty lines the first one and twenty form a
single long loose ill-assorted ill-constructed sentence3 the last nine are
word for word repeated elsewhere. All this is another proof that the
author left his work in an unfinished state. 82 qui didicere ε Hor.

91—106: well, as to the first question: this world and all its parts

had a beginning and will have an end: nay, any moment you may see it
all tumbling into ruin 3 may fortune avert this in our time! 91 ne
