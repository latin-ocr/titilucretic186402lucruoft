on this most knotty question one may agree rather With St Austin : si
nemo ex me quaerat quid sit tempus, scio: si quaerenti explicare velim,
jusseio. With these vv. should be comp. Epic. in Diog. Laert. x 72, or
the fuller passage of Sextus l. l. 219 Ἐπίκουρος δὲ...τὸν χρόνον σύμπτωμα
συμπτωμάτων εἶναι λέγει παρεπόμενον ἡμέραις τε καὶ νυξὶ καὶ ὥραις καὶ
πάθεσι καὶ ἀπαθείαις καὶ κινήσεσι καὶ μοναῖς. πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα συμπτώματιί
ἐστι τισὶ συμβεβηκότα. Time therefore is an accident of accidents:
Lucr. treats the question with reference to the accidents of body and

refer to Chrysippus and the stoics who as we saw taught that accidents
were bodily entities, time an immaterial entity: they doubtless therefore
used the homonymes esse, esse to prove that as for instance the rape
of Helen was, therefore the rape exists of itself, and the like. 466 haec
the rape of Helen and the conquest of Troy. 469 as usual, to make his
argument more vivid, he has taken a special case intelligible to all, the
conquest of Troy 3 this illustration he continues: Teucris therefore takes
the place of the generic Corporis of 482, reqionibus of loci: notice too the
quodcumque erit actum of a special past event, not aqetur. 471 he
seems here to pass from time, the accident of accidents, to the more
general question of 449, that of accidents generally. 473 conflatus
