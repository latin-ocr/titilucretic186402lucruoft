attached to the name of Lucretius is a very doubtful one occurring in
Mommsen's inser. reg. Neapol. Lat. 1653 ‘ Beneventi in aedibus archi-
episcopi.’ As Suetonius took great pains 111 searching out the best
original authorities for all his statements, the facts mentioned above,
even if somewhat coloured, must be accepted as true in the main, as
Lachmann observes p. 633 the more so that in February of the year
700 Cicero writes to his brother Quintus 11 11 the well-known sentence
Lucretii poemata ut scribis ita sunt cet. This is the only occasion on
which he ever mentions the poet's name, and it proves that four months
after the death of Lucretius he and his brother Quintus had read the
poem which, as we saw in the introduction to notes 1, could not have
been published in the author's lifetime. Now this seems too short a
time for the Ciceros to have read and to be writing about the work, if
neither of them had had anything to do with preparing it for publication.
But to which of the two brothers does J erome allude? in Latin or
English when Cicero or Oaesar is mentioned, if there is nothing else
to determine who is spoken of, the orator or the dictator is naturally
implied, and J erome in a dozen of his additions to the Eusebian
ehronicle thus denotes Marcus, But both Lachmann and Bernays
decide that Quintus must be meant: ‘in re nota' says the former
‘nihil opus fuit ut Ciceronis praenomen poneret, cum nemo ignoraret
Quintum intellegendum esse.’ But why it should be a res nota to
Jerome and his contemporaries or even to Suetonius I cannot see. Had
J erome found Quintus in his original, 110 must have added it, nor would
Suetonius himself have omitted to express it. Nor can I perceive the
least internal probability in favour of Quintus 3 who in those very
months must have been thinking more of the art of war than the art of
poeti-y, for in the summer of 7 00 he was fighting as Caesar's legate in
Gaul and Britain. And why should not Marcus be the editor? he does
not appear to have been very actively employed during those months ;
and moreover he was one of those busy men who always find time for
any fresh work they are called upon to do. It may have been a dying
request of the poet's, for it is more than likely from what he says of
Memmius that he would look on Cicero with admiration and esteem
him as the saviour of his country. Cicero's virtues and abilities were
just of the sort to excite the love ancl wonder of a retired student, who
is 111010 apt in practice to overrate than undervalue those who are en-
gaged in active life, whatever his speculative sentiments may be. And
here we are not left solely to conjecture: the many imitations we find in
Lucretius of the few hundred extant lines of Cicero’s Aratea prove, little
as it might have been expected, that he looked upon this translation as
one of his poetical models. Cicero, though he set small store on Epicurus
and his system, was on terms of intimate friendship with the leading
