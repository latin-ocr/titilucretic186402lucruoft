what Ν ewton 1. l. p. 260 says to illustrate this and the preceding section
557—564, ‘while the particles continue entire, they may compose
bodies of one and the same nature and texture in all ages 3 but should
they wear away or break in pieces, the nature of things depending on
them would be changed. Water and earth composed of old worn par-
ticles and fragments of particles would not be of the same nature aud
texture now with water and earth composed of entire particles in the
beginning. And therefore that nature may be lasting, the changes of
corporeal things are to be placed only in the various separations and
new associations and motions of these permanent particleS, compound
bodies being apt to break not in the midst of solid particleS‚ but where
those particles are laid together and only touch in a few points?
599—634: these first-beginnings have parts, but their parts are so
small as not to admit of existence separate from the atom: the atom
therefore has not been formed from a union of these parts, but they
have existed in it unchangeably from eternity: such parts then are but
one more proof that the first-beginnings are of everlasting singleness:
again without such ultimate least things, the smallest and largest thing
will alike consist of infinite parts, and thus will be equal: again if na-
ture went in division beyond the atom, such least things as these parts
of the atom could not have the qualities which birth-giving matter must
have, weight motion power of striking and clashing and combining.—
A passage necessarily obscure, because dealing with one of those ques·
tions which utterly elude the grasp of human reason. Epicurus building
up his dogmatic system and hating all scepticism on first principles,
determined that his atoms should have size shape weight‚ in his own
words μέγεθος σχῆμα βάρος, and therefore extension. But if extension,
then parts3 and how can that which has parts be indivisible'e This is
the question which Lucr. here answers. That the atoms of Epicurus
though extremely small were finite and had partS, abundant proof was

given in Camb. joui-nal of phil. 1 p. 28 soll. and 252 foll. Comp. Stob. -

ecl. Ι 10 14 εἴρηται δὲ ἄτομος, οὐχ ὅτι ἐστὶν ἐλαχίστη ἀλλ’ ὅτι οὗ δύναται
τμηθῆναι, ἀπαθής οὖσα καὶ οἷμέτοχος κενοῦ. Simplic. to Arist. phys. p.
216 a, a few lines from end, though he varies in his testimony about
Democritus, says of Epicurus οἷμερῆ μὲν οὐχ ἡγεῖται, ἅτομα δὲ αὐτοὶ διὰ
τὴν ἀπάθειαν εἶναί φησιε see the journal 1.1. for proof that Democritus
and Leucippus held the same doctrine which they probably derived from
the pythagoreans. Doubtless the epicurea-ns long waged bitter war
with the peripatetice who held the infinite divisibility of things: see
