BOOK VI 387

Lucr. seems to assume that the word πρηστήρ will indicate its fiery
nature without further specification. With this, and what follows, 438
Versabunclus eni-m turbo cet, 443 venti Vertex, 447 Turbinis—procellae
comp. Pliny l.l. 133 quod si maiore depressae nubis eruperit specu, secl
minus lato quam procella nec sine srayore, turbinem vocant promima

· quaeque prosternentem ,· idem ardentior accensusque olum furit, prester

vocatur amburens contacta pariter et proterens...quod si simul rupit nu-
bem exarsitque et iynem babuit, non postea concepit, fulmen est. clistat

procella latitudine ab utroque, disiecta nube verius quam rupta: Seneca

concitans turbo est. qui si puynacior est ac diutius volutatur, inflamma-

olus: 582 Versabunclaque portatur. 439 cum: see n. to 1 7 55. 440
simul ac qravidam, the only instance in Lucr. of ac before a guttural:
for the reason of this exception see n. to 1 281. 443 involvat cet. i. e.
does not get enclosed in the dense clouds, but eddying about catches up
stray particles of cloud and makes a case for itself. 446 Hic refers to
prestera of 4453 though it may include the imitation, as well as the
genuine prester. 447 Turbinis and procellae as well as vertex are
discriminated by Pliny cited above: turbinis then will denote the tor-
nado in the neighbourhood of the place where the prester bursts 3 procel-
lae the storm of wind spreading itself· far and near. 447 provomit
appears not to occur· elsewhere. 450 Prosp. maris in mayno i. e. 111

mari quod late, prospectum praebet: Ovid her. X 27 atque ita late
Aequora prospectu metior alta meo.

451—494: clouds are thus formed: first many particles in the sky
get entangled and form small clouds 3 and then these unite, until the
sky is overcast: thus high mountains are seen to smoke with mist, be-
cause the small particles of cloud are first carried to these by the wind:
then moisture steams up from the sea and rivers, and the pressure of
the ether above condenses it: finally many atoms, flying as I have
shewn through space, come into this heaven of ours, and increase the
mass from all sides—Epic. in Diog. Laer. Χ 99 gives a brief explana-
tion of clouds, agreeing essentially with this of Lucr. 453 moris,
properly whatever holds or detains, and thence it has the force of nexus:
Lach. compares 531 mora quae fluvios passim refrenat eunti33 Aen. x
485 Loricaeque moras 3 and refers to Sen. de benef. v 12 2 quia commis-
suras eorum et moras novit: comp. also Plaut. Stichus 309 fores facite ut
pateant: removete moram. 456 haec is fem. plur. as it appears to be
111 601 3 but see 11. there: hae does not occur in Lucra, and in his time
