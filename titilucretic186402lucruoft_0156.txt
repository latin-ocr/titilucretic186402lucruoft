138 NOTEs 11

earth, ether as the father descending in showers into the lap of mother
earth. The notion naturally had birth in warm elimates, such as India,
where the excessive heat at stated periods seemed to bring the ether down
in abundant rains which at once quiekened all things: hence the Agni
of the Rig-Veda cooperating with the mighty parents heaven and earth
to shed abundant showers. This notion too has induced Lucr. here and
elsewhere, where he speaks of aetheriae nubes and the like, to forget or
suppress for a moment his calm cloudless unsullied ether, and confound
it with this upper generator of heat and rain: the semper innubilus
aetlier of 111 seems in VI omnis in imbrem vertier.

252 nitidae sruqes occurs five times: it seems to imply crops well·
kept and so flourishing and good-looking: Cic. Verr. 111 47 says Quos eqo
campos antea collesque nitidissimos viridissimosque vidissem, hos ita vas-
tatos nunc ac desertos videbam, ut 3 Virg. georg. 1 153 interque nitentia
culta. fruqes in Lucr. signifies grain-crops alone or includes only legumi-
nous products in contradistinction to fruits of trees etc. 253 Wake-
field well observes that Virg. ecl. x 54 Arboribus: crescent illae, crescetis
amores, imitates the language and rhythm of this verse, while the sense
is quite different. Comp. also with 11 2, georg. 1 158 maynum alterius
srustra spectabis acervum· , with ΙΙ 32 and v 1395, georg. 11 310 Prae-

meaning is altogether dissimilar. Comp. also Aen. XII 906 vacuum per
inane said of the air3 though Lucr. once, 11 116, uses per inane himself 1n
the same way. Such instances shew how strongly this poem must have
impressed itself on Virgil's mind. 256 canere = cantu resonare. Fore.
