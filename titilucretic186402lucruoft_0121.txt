INTRODUOTION 103

mitted from one generation to another, taught as a necessary part of a
liberal education 31111 enforced 011 the writers of elegiae and lyrical
as well as of heroic verse, had no doubt a large share 111 fixing for many
centuries the outward form and inner nature of the language‚ the tendency
of which, as of its cognate dialects Oscan Umbrian and the like, was
towards rapid change 3 though perhaps in the end they caused it to come
down with a heavier crash, when at last the gulph between it and the
debased and degraded speech of the people became too immense. The
history of Attic and vulgar Greek is very similar. Complete however
as Ennius' system of quantity waS, quite as complete as that of virgil,
his rhythm from the nature of the case was somewhat rude and uncouth ε
113 attempted to imitate the Greek structure of verse in points where
there appeared to be a natural incompatibility between it and the Latin.
There is not evidence to shew by what steps this rhythm was gradually
improved, until at length in the hands of Vix-gil it attained that elabo-
rate 31111 complicated yet exquisite perfection‚ which is utterly different
from the Homeric movement, and yet appears as well adapted to the
Latin forms of speech as the other is to the Ionic. We have however
sufficient proof that Lucretius gave to the form of his verse as well as to
his'language an antique colouring‚ as if he wished in this respect too to
break with his contemporaries and approach to the manner of Ennius.
He is however 3 far more finished master of versification than Ennius,
and his most striking violations of the laws of construction habitually
observed by his contemporaries or immediate predecessors often produce
very fine and harmonicus effects. That he is more archaic 111 these
respects than his age may be proved not only by a comparison between
him and Catullus, but by taking note of t-he laws of metre observed
by Cicero in his youthful hexameters, which he must therefore have
learnt from his teachers. Let us examine briefly some of the leading
differences between the verse of Lucretius and that of Virgil and cer-
tain other authors. In the Latin and Greek hexameter alike the rhythm
mainly depends 011 the caesura. The due observance of this caesura
together with 3 manifold variety in the fiow of the verse forms the great
charm both of the Greek and the Latin heroic 3 and examples of its
violation are exceedingly rare in Homer Lucretius and virgil alike.
But other rules observed with equal care by Virgil and Catullus are re-
peatedly and intentionally neglected by Lucretius. Thus we find 111 him
hundreds of instances in which the first two feet are marked off from the
rest of the verse in the following unusual modes taken at random from
his six books: with two dactyls at the beginning Reliqionibus acque
minae, Omnia denique sancta, Suscipiendaque curarit, Quippe patentia
cum, Vertice Palladis ad templum: with a spondee and dactyl Eryo
