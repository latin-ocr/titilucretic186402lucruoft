BOOK 11 ’ 197

so used by Cicero, as div. in Caec. 61 tu, cam omnibus rebus inferior sis,
hae una in re cet. eqo, si superior omnibus rebus 33363, lianc unam ob

eausam cet. ε similarly 111 1026 Qui melior multis quam tn fait, improbe,
rebus. 177—181 recur, slightly altered, V 195—199. 179 red-
dere: see n. to 1 566 reddi. 181 stat. z Lach. cites Ι 564 Stare, and, a
doubtful instance, VI 1058 Pondere enim fretae partim stant: comp. too
Aen. 111 210 stant nomine dietae3 and Lucr. 11 843 manere, VI 1274
templa manebant. constare is much more usual with Lucr. in this sense.
184—215: you are to know too that nothing naturally mounts up-
wards: flames and the growth of crops and trees are only apparent
exceptions: thus blood from a wound spirts up; and a log forced down
into the water starts up again3 yet we know these things tend down-
wards by nature: so it is with flame: observe meteors and the like
falling to earth 3 the rays of the sun tending downwards3 lightnings
flying about and falling to the ground: this is their natural tendency.——
This argument is well and clearly put by Lucr.: it is directed against
the stoics: see notes to 1 1083 foll. where the same teachers are resuted 3
and the same false instances of fire crops and trees are cited. 184
Nune locus est: Virg. geor. 11 177 Nunc loeus arvorum inqeniis: est
being omitted, as so often by him compared with Lucr. 187 flam.
corp. a mere periphrasis for flammae: corpora are not here the prima
corpora. tibi dent fraudem z Cicero's facere fraudem alicui: see n. to
IV 41. 188 any. sum. recurs V 681. 191 subsiliunt: Cicero in
setting forth this stoical doctrine Tusc. disp. 1 40 uses the word subvo-
lent. 192 deyustant': so he himself, Virgil and Horace apply lam-
bere. tiyna trabesque here and VI 241 are used in their restricted sense:
tiyna the rafters let into the trabes or main beams: 196 they are used
generally for any large pieces of timber. 194 Quod yenus or quod
9enu8 est, an antique phrase which he and the auctor ad Herennium
often use: the latter appears always to omit est: this makes Lachmann’s
insertion of it here and elsewhere still more unjustifiable: here and in
the auctor ad Heren. it means no more than velut. 196 Nonne
vides: Lamb. notices his fondness for this phrase. 200 plus parte =
plus iusta parte or as he says himself 1V 1231 plus parte aequa3 i. e. it
starts farther out than it would be, if left alone: Ovid trist. 111 3 16 Et
plus in nostro pectore parte tenes 3 v 10 29 simul nobis habitat discri-
mine nullo Barbarus et tecti plus qaoque parte tenet ε in all these places

it may mean plus dimidia parte 3 as 1 617 pars 3 and Germanicus Caesar
Arat. phaen. 588 Bootes In terras abit et noctis plns parte relinquit : he
means clearly more than half of night, though the expression of Aratus
583 is very obscure, πλεῖον δίχα νυκτός ἷούσηςε Cicero 364 translates
recedit Post mediam labens claro cum corpore noctem. multia omnibus
partibas are also very indefinite in meaning. Ovid met. 111 43 has then
