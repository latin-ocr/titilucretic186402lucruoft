31¹7 fraqore: see 11. 130 1 747 fraqori: the metaphor is clearly from bat-
tering the walls of a fortress.

318—323: if as some say the all-environing ether begets all things
and takes them back at death, then must it be mortal 3 for it is thus
subject to increase and decrease.—This passage is an argumentum ad
hominem: the notion pleases his poetica] fancy, and he has already
more than once seized on the thought and given to it an epicurean turn:
see what has been said to 1 250, and especially 11 991 foll. which has
much resemblance to 131118, caelesti sumus omnes semine oriundi, and
1000 quod missumst ex aetheris oris cet.: the consciousness of this pre—
vents him from giving a denial to the theory here3 and he contents
himself with leaving it as hypothetical: si procreat cet. in which there
is doubtless irony mixed. The passage is a close paraphrase of Pacuvius
86 Hoc vide, circum supraque quod complexu continet Terram...I d quod
nostri caelum memorant, Grai perhibent aethera Quidquid est hoc, omnia
animat format alit auqet creat Sepelit recipitque in sese omnia, omnium-
que idem est pater, Indidemque eadem quae oriuntur, cle inteyro aeque
eodem occidunt. 320 quocl quidam memorant therefore are Pacuvius
and whoever they are whom he follows, be they stoics or scholars of
Plato or Pythagoras or Anaxagoras or whoever else chooses to allegorise
in a like spirit. Pacuvius himself was probably thinking of Zeno: he
says 93 Mater est terra: ea parit corpus, animam aether adiuqat. 323
Deminui, recreari, and thereby to be mortal: 111 517 At neque transferri
sibi partis nec tribui vult I nmortale quocl est quicquam neque defluere
hilum 3 Nam cet.

324—350: if the world had no beginning, why did history com-
mence with the wars of Thebes and Troy? nay the world began but
lately3 and 80 arts and sciences are still in progress: if it be said all
these existed before, but were destroyed by some great catastrophe, then
you must the more admit that the world will come to an end: when it
suffered so grievously, had the causes been more powerful, it must have
perished altogether: thus we all know we shall (116, because we have
the same diseases as those who are already dead. 326 fun. Tros
Hor. od. 1 8 14 sub lacrimosa Troiae Funera. 330 summa: as he is
speaking of our mzmclus, summa is here haec summa or haec rerum
summa: see n. to 1 1008. 331 exordia cepit: Aen. 1v 284 quae
prima exordia sumat? geor. 1v 316 Unde nova inqressus hominum
cooperientia cepit? 334 orqanici cet: ΙΙ 412 musaea mele, per chor-
das orqanici quae . . fiqurant. 336 cusm primis merely strengthens
primus, first of all, before all others ε VI 225 subtilem cum primis iyni-

434. 342 cooperuisse: see n. to 11 1061 coluerint. 343 Tanto
