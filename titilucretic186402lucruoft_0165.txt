an off-hand decision given anywhere in a simple case, in contradistinction
to a more formal and deliberate judgment from the bench. Lucr. means
to say that he needs no time for consideration 3 so sure is he of his case.
There appears to be no authority for de plano in the sense of plane.
412 e font. de pect. in one sentence: comp. 1V 694 Ex alto quia vix
emittitur ex re 3 VI 1012 ex elementis .. e ferro 3 11 447 In quo iam yenere
in primis 3 IV 973 VI 721. Aen. VI 404 Ad. 9enitorem...descendit ad
umbras. 413 meo diti de pect. this use of the poss. pron. with an adj.
seems an imitation of Ennius' antique manner, often imitated by VirgiL
as tuo cumflumirie sancto for instance: see n. to IV 394 suo corpore claro.
Comp. Hor. epist. 11 2 120 Vemeris et liquidus puroque simillimus amni
Fundet opes Latiumque beabit divite linqua 3 Hor. applying dives to the
linqua, which is supplied by the pectus 3 the heart being the seat of the
intellect according to Lucr. and most ancient philosophers: V 1 pollenti
pectore carmen Condere. Wak. quotes Cic. de consul. suo 74 Fuderunt
claras secandi pectoris artis. diti: on the other hand v 1115 Divitioris:
he nowhere else uses either form. 414 tarda surely agrees with se-
nectus. 415 vit. cb: this metaph. he twice repeatS, 111 396 mayis est
animas vitai claustra coercens3 VI 1153 vitai claustra lababant: comp.
too Cicero's words cam eqo claustra ‘nobilitatis refreyissem. The words
imply those bars and defences which have to be forced and broken open
before body and soul can be severed and life destroyed.

418—448: all nature then consists of body, and void in which body
moves: deny the existence of body, you take away the foundation on
which rests all reasoning about abstruse things: without void no motion
is possible as I have just shewn. There is no third nature distinct from
these two: if a thing can touch or be touched, it is of the class of body 3
if it cannot, of void: neither sense nor reason can grasp any third class.
418 repet. pertexere: VI 936 repetam commemorare the same constr. In
both cases the inf. is for the accus. He uses the inf. for a subst. in the
nomin. often: see n. to 331 z sometimes for the accus. as IV 245 interno-
scere curat 3 v 1186 pmquium sibi habebant omnia divis Tradere 3 VI 68
remittis Dis indiyna putare 3 1227 quod ali dederat vitalis aeris auras
Volvere in ore licere et caeli templa tueri, where a second infin. depends on
the first used as an accus. subst.: repet. then has precisely the force it
has Ovid met. 111 151 Propositum repetamus opus, and ars 111 747 Sed
repetamus opus: the metaph. in pertexere is obvious: VI 42 inceptum
peryam pertemere dictis. 419 iyitur is more than once put by Lucr. in
the apodosis and has misled editors: IV 199—903 si, quae...Quid quae
sunt iyitur 3 862—865 quae quia sunt...H is iqit‘ar rebus rarescit: in both
which 'passages Laoh. has gone wrong3 as the older editors have in the
present one : comp. also 1v 513-520 Denique ut...Sic icitur ratio 3 and
V 260 Eryo. Sometimes too Lucr. places igitur late in the sentence 3
