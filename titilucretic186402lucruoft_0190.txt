830-8'74: the homoeomeria of Anaxagoras is equally defective:
everything he supposes to consist of infinitely small particles of the same
nature as the thing: bones of small bones, and so on: he denies too
void and any limit to the division of things, like those above mentioned:
such first-beginnings as 1311636 cannot resist destruction, so that things
would return to nothing. Again, as food increases the body, the parts
of the body are formed of things different in kind: or if you say all
food has particles like the parts of the body contained in it, then meat
and drink consist of particles different in kind: the same dilemma will
apply to what grows out of the earth, to flame latent in wood‚ and the
like—Thais Lucr. had much sympathy with Anaxagoras will be seen
at 11 991 foll. where he translates from Euripides and adapts to his own
purpose a passage founded upon Anaxagoras’ system. There were also
other points of contact: Anaxagoras held, as did Epicurus, that the sum
of matter in the universe was always the same, and that nothing could
pass into nothing. Though Lucr. 847 foll. tries to show that Anaxago-
ras’ principles lead to a different conclusion, he sayS, frag. 22 Schaub.

ἀπόλλυσθαι οὔκ ὀρθῶς νομίζουσιν οἱ Ἕλληνες · οὐδὲν γὰρ χρῆμα γίνεται οὐδ’
ἀπόλλυται, ἀλλ’ ἀπ’ ἐόντων χρημάτων συμμίσγεταί τε καὶ ἀποκρίνεται. The
many points of difference Lucr. himself clearly shews: see also 13116

His refutation of Anaxagows much resembles even in language his argu-
ment against Empedocles. 832 patr. serm. eya see above p. 100
foll.: these words are quoted by Pliny epist. 1v 18.

834 homoeomerian: the word is not found in the few extant frag-
ments of Anaxagoras, but Lucr. distinctly here states that he did use it:
Lucr. seems to denote by the term the relation which existed between
the things in being and the particles like in kind, of which they were
composed‚ ἄπειρα, 63 Anaxagoras says frag. 1, καὶ πλῆθος καὶ σμικρότηταε
'these he himself names σπέρματα or χρήματα, Aristotle τοὶ ὁμοιομερῆ
στοιχεῖα, οἷόρατα ὁμοιομερῆ, and the like: the later Greeks call them ὁμοιο-
μερεῖαι 111 13116 plur. probably from some misconception. 835 foll. most
or all of the examples here given are found in Aristotle Simplicius and
others, so that they were doubtless employed by Anaxagoras himselfi
