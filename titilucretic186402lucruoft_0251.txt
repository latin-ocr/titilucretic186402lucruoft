1089, especially of that contained in 1058—1063, the intervening vss.
1090—1104 containing one of his many impassioned appeals. diemque
Primiqenum—coortum is a mere poetical repetition of the preceding
wordS. 1106 Primiqenum is a rare word, for which lexicons only
cite Avienus besides Lucr.: perhaps he wished to translate the Homerie
πρωτόγονος. 1107 corpora and Semina are of course synonymes.
1110 Appareret: I find no other example of the use of this verb which
is here very expressive: Faber compares the Greek προσκτᾶσθαι caeli
domus: he may have been thinking of Ennius' strange divum domus
altisonum cael: Aen. x 1 domus omnipotentis Olympi: but Lucretius'
expression implies more. 1111 consurqeret: one can hardly say whe-
ther this is simply for suryeret, or, what is more graphio, sor undique
circu-m suryeret, or even suryeret una cum caelo. This formation of our
world is much more fully delineated v 449—508: above, 1058—-1063,
he described the exordia of this world 3 here he pictures its completion.
1112 playis: these blows of atoms are, as we have so often seen before,
the chief cause of the formation and conservation of things, by enabling
the atoms to clash and try all kinds of union, until some suitable one is
found. 1114 umor, terra, iynes, aether are used here loosely and poe-
tically for the elements fitted by their shape etc. to assist in forming
water earth etc. 1115 procudunt, as 111 1081 N ec nova vivendo pro-
cuditur ulla voluptas, v 850 propayando procudere saecla, 856 propa-
9ando procudere prolem. aetheraque aether: for aeraque aer, since the
poet here employs Empedocles for his own purpose, just as 991 foll.
he made use of Anaxagoras and Euripides: Emped. 270 πυρὶ δ’ αὐξά-
νεται πῦρ, αὔξει δὲ χθών μὲν σφέτερον δέμας αἰθέρα δ’ αἷθήρτ in form
his vss. are rather a reminiscence of the more famous vss 321 Γαίῃ μὲν
γὰρ γαῖαν ὀπώπαμεν ὕδατι δ’ ὕδωρ Αἰθέρι δ’ αἰθέρα δῖον, οἷτοῖρ πυρὶ πῦρ
οἷίδηλονε elsewhere too Emped. thus uses αἰθήρ, as 105 Πῦρ καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ
γαῖα καὶ αἰθέρος ἤπιον ὕψος, and 0216. Lucr. has probably only followed
Empedocles here, but see 11. to 1 250 aether, where it is shewn that
he sometimes uses the word strictly, sometimes for the upper regions
generally and the seat of rain ε thus in one place he has aetheriae nubes,
in another innubilus aether, in a third aetherias auras. 1116 Doni-
que: this form of donec recurs v 708, 723, 997. donicum is quite
unknown to him. perfica=perfectrix 1119 venas seem here and
elsewhere to include the arteries as well as veins. 1121 refrenat
a favourite word of his. 1122 adauctu, used by Lucr. alone of good
writers. 1126 dispessa: see notes 1 : it must agree with quaecumque,
and refer to things which have attained the fulness of their growth:
the atoms are dispersa, but not the res: for form comp. Gellius xv 15
Plautus in milite ylorioso [360] a littera in e mutata, per compositi voca-
buli morem dispessis dicit cet. 1127 vescitur is quite suitable here:
