BOOK 1v 307

the animus and anima, and the propulsion from without by the entrance
of the outer air. velis ventoque then do not appear to correspond fully
to this twofold cause of motion 3 as they would seem to represent merely
the effect of the outer air on the body. Gassendi therefore had some
reason for proposing ‘remis ventoque: the ‘remis would answer well
enough to the anima and its effect on the body. The only way I can
explain the text is this: the body alone would be like the hull of the
vesseL upon which the wind could make no effectual impression 3 the
lighter and subtler anima represents the light and flexible sails upon
which the wind can work with a good result: but this is scarcely per-
haps satisfactory. 899 Tantula tantum corpus corpuscula: v 593
Tantalus ille queat tantum sol mittere lumen: but this love of antithesis
shews itself in a hundred ways in Lucr. as we have seen and shall see:
901 suptili corpore tenuis, maqnam maqno molimine 3 905 pondere ma9n0,
levi nisu. 902 molimine expresses the momentum of the huge ship
in motion: Livy 11 56 4 res suo ipsa molimine qravis. It may refer
however to the great force of the impelling wind3 as Ov. met. XII 356
solidoque revellere trunco Annosam quercum maqno molimine temptat.
904 contorquet of steering, as 900 Contorquere 3 Aen. 111 562 Contorsit
laevas proram Palinurus acl undas. 905 trocleas were certain arrange-
ments of blocks of pulleys, described by Cato and Vitruvius. tympana
seem to have been wheels which revolved by men treading on them, and
raised to their places columns and other heavy weights 3 both the trocleas
and tympana being portions of the same machina. 905 pondere maqno
abl. of quality depending on Multa: it gains force by its position:
comp. V 556 quam maqno pondere nobis Sustineat corpus tenuissima vis
animai3 Aen. lx 512 Saxa quoque infesto volvebant pondere 3 X 381
maqno vellit dum pondere saxum.

907—928: sleep takes place, when the soul is scattered in the body,
and part of it has gone out, part withdrawn into the depths of the body:
only part however can go forth 3 else death would ensue: enough must
stay behind to let sense be rekindled‚ as fire is rekindled when buried
under the ashes. 90¹7 somnus cet: Macrob. sat. VI 1 44 compares
