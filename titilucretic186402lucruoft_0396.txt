sound.—We again come to matters beyond the certain test of sense3
of which therefore many explanations may be and are equally true: the
remarks appended to v 533 will apply here and to what follows. 99
N ec fit enim i. e. nee enim, or neque enim fit. 105 Nam cadere aut for
nam aut cadere, an idiomatical irregularity such as all Latin and Greek
writers allow themselves, and which cannot be refused to Lucr.: indeed
114 Aut ubi..cliartasve is of much the same character 3 and v 383 vel
cum sol is more violent: see n. there. bruto: Paulus Fest. p. 31
‘brutum antiqui gravem dicebant.’ 108 aeq. mun: Attius 223 Sed
quid tonitru turbida torvo Gonoussa repente aequora caeli Sensimu'
sonere. 109 Carbasus cet.: IV 75 lutea russaque vela Et ferruyina
omn maynis intenta theatris Per malos volyata trabesque trementia flu-
tant, where see notes. 112 commeditatur seems not to occur for certain
anywhere else : it must mean to get up and practise a subject, and thus
represent or imitate it. 114 Aut ubi i. e. ubi aut s. v. aut chartas cet.
or, vel. . vel: Plaut. asin. 522 Quotiens te vetui Ar9urippum . . Compellare
aut contrectare conloquive aut contui. 119 Aridus—ducitur: the sound
well represents the sense. Aridus: Virg. geor. 1 357 aridus altis Mon-
tibus audiri fraqor.

121—131: sometimes the thunder makes a noise like the crack of
doom, when a storm of wind eddies round within a cloud and hollows it
out, until at last it explodes with a frightful crash. 124 ven. prom:
293 ventique procella. 125 intorsit is more emphatic than involvit.
12¹7 spisso cava, the greater the hollow, the denser the crust. 131
dat maqnum: see notes 1 3 and comp. 140. 129 scissa i. e. nubes:
Isidor. orig. x111 8 paraphrases this passage: he too seems to have read.
missa: see Lach.: Pliny nat. hist. 11 113 posse et...spiritum nube cohibi-
tum tonare, natura stranyulante sonitum dum rimetur, edito frayore cum
erumpat, ut in membrana spiritu intenta, might also seem in favour of
the ms. reading missa 3 yet Lach. must I think be right. Epic. himself
in Diog. Laer. x 100 foll. gives a brief summary of the possible causes
first of thunder, then of lightning, and then of the other heavenly phe-
nomena, πρηστῆρες etc. which Lucr. discusses: the two are generally in
close accordance.

132—159 : thunder may likewise come from winds blowing through
rough branchy clouds 3 or from the wind bursting the cloud by a direct
onset: or waves may break in the clouds, like those on the sea 3 or the
hot bolt may fall into a wet cloud and hiss like hot iron 3 or into a dry
one and make it crackle like bay-leaves in the fire: again the crash of
hail and 166 111 the clouds compressed by the wind may be the cause.
