make the birds first feel the coming of spring: ‘ So priketh hem nature
in hir corages'. 13 perculsae is literally ‘ knocked down, struck to the
ground': see Forcellinus and Bentl. to Hor. epod. XI 2: hence often
‘stmmed, smitten through all the frame' by a strong passion, as here
¹ by love, 261 by a strong natural craving: comp. Plaut. trin. 242 Nam
qui amat, quod amat, quom eaetemplo eius saviis perculsus est, where per-
culsus is restored from the Ambrosian, the other mss. having per-
cussus, with which it is so often confused.

but again and again in Lucr. and others pecudes and serae in formal
contrast. Wak. misquotes Martial, and besides him only quotes or
misquotes mere barbarians in language Hilary and Tertullian to support
serae pec. Forbiger refers to Varro de re rust. 11 1 5 and Colum. IX 1,
passages which make strongly against him: by pec-ucles serae Varro means
tame animals or pecudes found in a wild state, viz. sheep goats swine
bulls 68868 horses3 Columella goats deer boars, which though wild may
yet be kept in herds on 611 estate. Again ferae is awkward‚ as 1361116
beasts are as much moved as wild. Ovid fasti 1v, where he is imitating
Lucr. speaks of tame brutos only3 Virg. geor. 111 242 foll. of both tame
and wild, and it is of 1116168 116 says flumina tranant. 0611 jer ae pec.

highly prob. ‘’generally, ‘without exception’: so 11 370 Ad sua quisque

occurs 6 or 7 times with armenta, arbusta, vineta: thus Virg. laetas
seyetes and the like. But it was also 6 word of the people: see Cato
