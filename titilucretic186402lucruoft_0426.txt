such thing: with his usual caution he tells us that it began, ὥς λέγεται,
111 Aethiopia, and descended to Egypt and Persia3 and suddenly broke
out in Athens beginning with the Piraeus 3 so that it is possible a ship
carried it direct from Egypt. 1141 veniens, ortus, permensus: see

cet.: it cannot fairly be questioned that in these vss. Lucr. misi-epresents
Thuc. who says that the disease first attacked the head, then the throat
and tongue, then 1. l. ἐν οὗ πολλῷ χρόνῳ κατέβαινεν ἐς τὰ στήθη ὁ πόνος,
and then always descending, ὁπότε ἐς τὴν καρδίαν στηρίξαι, ἅνέστρεφέ τε

ἐπῄεσαν, i.e.<as all the commentators of Thuc. explain it, when it got
below the breast and reached the stomach‚ discharges of bile of every
sort took place 3 it being expressly stated on good authority that by καρ-
δία the ancients, particularly Hippocrates and Thuc„ denoted τὸ στόμα
τῆς γαστρός. But Lucr. has evidently taken καρδία 111 its usual sense:
such a mistake was not unlikely to occur 5 but it has caused him sadly
to misrepresent the case: he makes the disease not merely descend into
the breast, but wholly fill the breast, and stream together into the sad
heart, and thus at the very commencement of its course force all the
fastnesses of life, though the patients afterwards go through many stages
of suffering and live at least eight or nine days: Thuc. says some sen-
tences later διεξῄει γὰρ διὰ παντὸς τοῦ σώματος ἄνωθεν ἀρξάμενον τὸ ἐν τῇ
κεφαλῇ πρῶτον ἱδρυθὲν κακόν. This error of Lucr. was pointed out by
Victorius three centuries ago in his variae lectiones XXVIII 17 and more
fully in a letter to Hieronymus Mercurialis published by Passow in
1832: Lamb. in vain asserts that Lucr. here uses eor for stomachus
after the Greeks: his wide departure from Thuc. and the whole turn of
his language prove that cor here, as elsewhere, means the seat of life3
nor is there the least authority for supposing that eor could have any
other meaning. 1153 vit. eL: 1 415 vitai claustra resolvat: see
