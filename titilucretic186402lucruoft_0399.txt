ipsi ante volvuntur et ob hoc maiore impetu incurrunt. 197—203 are
a good example of Lucretius’ powers of graphio description.

204—218: fire of a clear gold. colour sometimes darts down to the
earth, because the clouds have in them many atoms of fire, and draw
many from the sun3 when therefore they are compressed by the wind,
they emit these seeds of fiame without noise or disturbance. 204

Compressit, coqens his favourite pleonastical assonance 3 followed by eoc-
pressa which answers to⁴ compressit. 213 fulyere: see 11. to 160

Fulyit, and 11 27 fulyet: Lach. to maintain his own consistency in re-
gard to the conjugation of fulyere forces on Lucr. a monstrous incon-
sistency 3 for fulyore can only mean that the atoms of fire produce the
colour of fiame by their own brightness‚ though Lucr. in 11 took such
vast pains to prove that atoms could not have colour or any other
secondary quality: the atoms by their action 182 faciunt nictantia ful-
9uraflammae, and 217 faciunt fulyorem: so here too faciunt flammae
fulqere colores, which is the same thing. 216 inyratis: see n. to
111 935.

219—238: the marks left by the thunderbolts themselves prove
them to be of the nature of fire: this fire consists of atoms of extreme
fineness, which nothing is able to stop: they are far more powerful than
those of the sun.--He now, as we observed at 160, comes to the ful-
mina, having discussed first the tonitru or clap, and then the fulqur or
flash: see n. to 160, where this was fully illustrated. 220 ictus, like
vulnera and cognate wordS, sometimes denotes the result of the stroke
as well as the stroke itself : indeed if the results are lasting, as in the
cases here specified, it is impossible to separate the two meanings. 221
halomtis is best taken as the nom. plur.: notae halantes gravis auras sul-
puris. sulpuris: Pliny xxxv 177 fulmina et fulyura quoque sulpuris
odorem habent, ac lum ipsa eorum sulpurea est3 Sen. nat. quaest. 11 53 2
