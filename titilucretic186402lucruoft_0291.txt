meet: the epicureans and stoics had many points in common, and among
these that of calling the rest of the world fools: stolidus he twice 11808,
and both times of the stoics, as we have seen. With what precedes

1024—1052 : you may say too to yourself ‘the best and greatest kings
conquerors sages poets, Epicurus himself, have died 3 why should I then
seek to live, who dream away life amid cares and delusionsl’ 1024
possis: this potential Lucr. delights in, as has been 80 often noted above.
1025 the words are· from Enn. ann. 150 Postquam lumina sis oculis

right in making the whole of this passa-ge a soliloquy of the reader. sis:

fulmina belli, Scipiadas, cladem Libyam Silius VII 106 ubi nunc sunt
fulmina yentis, Scipiadae, xv 340 Cartlcayinis horror: all these passages
might have reference to a lost one of Ennius or other old poet, and it 18
natural enough that both the elder and younger Africanus should be
termed thunderbolts of war, but then Cic. pro Balbo 34 says cum duo

fulmina metri imperii subito in Hispania Cn. et P. Scipiones extincti
