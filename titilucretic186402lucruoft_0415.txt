p. 30. 737 Tabificis is a common enough word, but hardly occurs
elsewhere 111 this sense.

738—768: Avernian districts are so called because birds cannot
live there: there is one at Cumae, another in the acropolis of Athens,
another in Syria: the effects are quite natural, so that you need not
look on them as the gates of hell. '740 quoi Averna cet.: quod has
here much the same force as 1v 885 Id quod providet and the passages
quoted in n. there: the explanation of why they are called by the name
of Averna is this: without Averna Lachmann's quo for quod would be
very well3 with it his reading is scarcely intelligible, '742 loca
venere: the accus. after venio, except in the case of domum or the name
of a town, is not common: Aen. 11 7 42 Quam tumulum antiquae Cereris
sedemque sacratam Venimus. '743 Remiyi: see n. to 716 etesiae:
this licence also he employs only twice: see n. to IV 741. Rem. pen.:
Aen. 1 301 Remiyio alarum, VI 19 Remigium alarum. 744 profusae:
Festus p. 229 ‘profusus...alias abiectus iacens, ut Pacuvius in Teucro
Profusus yemitu cet.' '74¹7 Is locus cet.: there is no reason to doubt
what he and Virgil say of the Avernian lake when it was surrounded
by thick wood: see Servius to Aen. 111 442. ‘N o bones existed in the
valley at the time I visited it, excepting of some birds who in crossing
the valley had been arrested on the wing by the noxious effluvia as
at the lake of Avernus of old ' Prof. Daubeny quoted in Murray's hand-
book for south Italy, ed. 2 p. 304, speaking of what is supposed to be
the Ampsancti valles: exactly the same is told of some marshes in the
Carolinas surrounded by thick woods by a traveller Bosc in the early
part of this century. '753 fuyitant own i.e. non fuqitant cet„ Sed
natura cet. ¹754 Perviyili is the gen. of perviqilium: he doubtless
alludes to the famous story told at length by Antigonus of Carystus
quoted by Lamb. and Ovid met. Π 542-565, how the daughters of
Cecrops disobeying the orders of Pallas opened the chest in which the
infant Ericthonius was shut up, how the watchful crow espied them and
fiew away and told it to Pallas, who in anger at the bad news expelled
· that and 311 other crows for ever from her acropolis. ‘As to the crow,
the explanation seems to be that these birds, which are seen in great
numbers around the rocks of the acropoliS, seldom rise to the summit'
Leake Athens 1 p. 206: at all events no Avernian exhalations are now
perceived there. To what Greek poets Lucr. alludes I do not know.
¹755 loci ope: see 11. to 111 374 animae elementa, and 1V 741. ope suapte
1. 0. sua ipsius opera: Festus p. 310 ‘suopte suo ipsius, ut meopte meo
ipsius, tuopte tuo ipsius'. 756 In Syria quoque: Cic. de div. 1 79
non videmus quam sint varia terrarum yenera? ex quibus et mortifera
quaedam pars est, ut et Ampsancti in Hirpinis et in Asia Plutonia quae
vidimus cet.: these latter may be the same to which Lucr. alludes, fian
