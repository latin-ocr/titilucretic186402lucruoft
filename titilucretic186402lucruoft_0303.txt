to have been written for VI, and brought hither by the poet, perhaps as
a temporary makeshift : see notes 1. 220 eoeesor seems not to occur

230—26'7 : we feel a thing in the dark, and know it to be the same
as we saw in the light: if what we feel is square, what square object can
come in the light to our sight except its image, since a like effect must
have a like 6611862 images proceed from things in all directions 3 but as
we only see with the eyes, we only see images where we turn our sight
to them. Again an image pushes before it the air between it and the
eye 3 this air all sweeps through the pupil, and lets 118 judge of the dis-
tance of the object seen3 and all this takes places almost instanta-
neously: we do not see the images singly, but we see the object by a
continuous succession of these3 just as we do not feel each particle of
wind, but the effect of the whole: and so too we thump the surface of
a stone, but feel its inner hardness 233 Cons. causa, since the effect
