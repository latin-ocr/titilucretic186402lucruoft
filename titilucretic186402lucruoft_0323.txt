BOOK 1v 305

λαμβάνειν, and a few lines after οὗ ὃιοὶ τοὶς χεῖράς ἐστιν ὅ ἅνθρωπος
φρονιμώτατος, ἅλλοὶ ὃιαῖ τὰφρονιμῶτατον εἶναι τῶν ζῴων ἔχει χεῖρας; l. l.

στραφέντος καταχθῆναι συνέβη. 831 ad vitam quae foret usus: V 844
nec sumere quod foret usus, quae I take to be the accus.: comp. Plaut.
pseud. 385 Ad eam rem usust hominem astutum doctum scitum et cal-
lidum, or facere may be supplied: for Lucr. 1268 Nec molles opu) sunt
motus, like other writerS, uses the plur. verb with a nom. plur. 832
inter quaec. precantur: see n. to 1 452. 836 videre, 83¹7 orare, 843
conferre, 844 lacerare, foedare, 848 mandare, 850 sedare all = nom.
subst.: see n. to 1 331. 841 foret usus: usus has here of course its
ordinary sense: foret usus above with the meaning of foret opus seems
to have suggested to him the use of the words here in another sense:
comp. 1 875 latitandi...latitare, and n. there. 843 Αὐ contra etc:
Arist. de part. anim. 1 5 and 1V 10 goes over much the same ground as-
Lucr. here, and comes to exactly opposite conclusions: he uses the tools
made by a man as a proof that the tools made by nature had the same
end in view, the hand being ὦσπερεὶ ὄργανον πρὸ ὀργάνωνε 13116 body and
all its parts are made for the functions they perform, as the saw is made
for the sake of sawing: the sawing is not done for the sake of the saw.

esse quin is a more common expression.

858—8'76: the body requires food, because it loses many particles
constantly, and thus an aching void is produced, which has to be filled
up and the pain allayed: liquid 1300 13 taken into the body and quenches
the particles of heat 111 13116 stomach: thus both thirst and hunger are
appeased.-—These vss. 1300, 63 Lach. p. 259 shews, are well adapted to
the general subject of 1v, but here interrupt the connexion of the argu-
ment and are manifestly an after-thought of the poet’s. 860 fluere
cet.: 11 1128 Nam certe· fluere adque recedere corpora rebus M ulta manus
dandum est: this with what precedes and follows is what the poet refers
to in docui, together with perhaps IV 218—229: 1v 695 Nam penitus
fluere atque recedere rebus odores. 865 iqiiur in the apodosis: see 11.
