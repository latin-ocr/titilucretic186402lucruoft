31—93 z I have now to explain the real nature of the soul and to
dispel the terrours of hell which poison life ι many boast they know all
this, but when tried by adversity, they choose to suffer any misery rather
than face death and its consequences : nay often men from this sear will
commit any crime, in order to get wealth and honour, thinking that
want and contempt destroy the security of life 3 hence civil war, hence
hatred of relations 3 hence men often rush to death from fear of death:
this sear in short is the source of all evils, and can be destroyed only
by the true knowledge of nature. 31 cunct. eaeor. rer. :rerum pri-
