the famous sacrificial formula hoc aye, so often adopted by Latin writers:
it seems to have struck Plutarch as a foreigner: he more than once
explains the OK ΑΓΕ, 68 in Coriol. p. 225, προσέχειν τοῖς ἱεροῖς καὶ

Catullus in his train: see Schwab. 0611111. 1 p. 158 foll. He certainly
did not return to Rome before 698, and the year following Lucr. died.

Gaius Memmius, son of Lucius, of the Galerian tribe had, like the ,
rest of his family, no cognomen ; although he has very generally received
