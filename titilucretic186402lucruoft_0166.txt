148 Noa-Es 11

11 678, where the partic. =a protasis, it is the 7th‚ 682 1116 6111 word:
11 569 itaque 6011163 5111 111 1116 sentence, Iv 705 4th: VI 1277 enim is the
9th word. 419 perse manifestly belongs to ut est, not to constitit with
which Lach. joins it: ut est has no force alone, and the assertion would
contradict Epicurus: comp. Cic. de nat. deor. 11 82 sunt autem qui omnia
naturae nomine appellent, ut Epicurus qui ita dividit, omnium quae sint
naturam esse corpora et imme quaeque his accidam5 in precise conformity
with which Lucr. says 445 tertia per 36 Nulla potest cet: see too 422 440
and 459 Tempus item per 36 non est and 445 and 479 : from all which it
is clear Lucr. does not deny that ‘ accidents' are, but denies that they
exist by themselves, per 36. See too Epicurus' own words in Diog.
Laert. X 68 οὔθ’ ὦς καθ’ ἑαυτάς εἶσι φύσεις [τά σχήματα κ.τ.λ.] δοξα-
στέον, 611(1 111036 6116(1 61 445, which Lucr. almost translates

419 duabus In rebus: 449 duabus Rebus: 503 duarum rerum: the
only three cases, all too exactly similar, where Lucr. seems to depart
from his ordinary use of the word res which occurs many hundred times
in his poem. Elsewhere 11 has either one of its numerous abstract mean-
ings3 or denotes things in being opposed to the first-beginnings out of
which things in being are formed. Here too it might be urged it has
almost an abstract meaning, and denotes the general conception of body
and void 3 which he expresses sometimes by natura. Lucr. might have
employed the simple neut. of the adj. lois duobus, and by long habit he
seems to have looked on his duabus rebus as equivalent to that. A Greek
poet could hardly have used οὐσία 01· 1116 like3 nor a modern ‘entity’
‘ substance' or any such term, derived too in almost every instance from
scholastic Latin. 420 what is the exact force of the perf. Constitit,
which Lamb. and Oreech will not tolerate? is it this: ‘ever has been
and remains grounded’‚ or can it have that common force of the Greek
ἦν ι13, 63 we have said'l Conse. in seems to be used in the sense
common enough in Cicero, as in philip. 111 19 cum in eo salus et vita
optimi cuiusque. . ,comi-steret 3 but this I believe to be the sole instance of
such a use in Lucr. corpora has here its most extended sense: comp.
483: it includes all corpus, whether corpora prima or res: so Epic.
himself in Plut. adv. Colot. 13 τήν τῶν ὄντων φύσιν σώματα εἶναι καὶ
κενόν. 422 comm. sensus signifies the universal feeling or sensation
common to all alike, which serves as the basis on which all judgments
are built up: comp. Epic. in Diog. Laert. x 39 τοῖ σώματα ὦς ἔστιν αὐτὴ
ἤ αἴσθησις ἐπὶ πάντων μαρτυρεῖ, καθ’ ἢν ἀναγκαῖον τὸ ἄδηλον τῷ λογισμῷ
τεκμαίρεσθαι. 423 cui valebit must = cui firme habebitur: fundata»
would require the abl. as Lamb. felt who tacitly wrote quo. 426 foll.
Lucr. again closely follows Epic. 1,1. 40 εἰ μὴ ἦν ὃ κενὸν καὶ χώραν καὶ
οἷναφῆ φύσιν ὀνομάζομεν, οὐκ ἂν εἶχε τοὶ σώματα ὅπου ἦν οὐδὲ δι’ οὗ
ἐκινεῖτο, καθάπερ φαίνεται κινούμενα. 4274 si nullum foret = Si non foret:
