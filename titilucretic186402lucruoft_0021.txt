INTRODUCTION 3

1849. Of the copies in England I have had in my hands at least
seven3 one of these belonging to our Cambridge library has been open
before me the whole time Ι was writing my critical notes. In the
imperial library of Paris I have cast my eye over several unimportant
copies. Those manuscripts which have been of any importance in
forming the text will be more fully spoken of, after the printed editions

’ have been discussed.

The editio princeps, of which only three copies are known, was
printed about 1473 by Ferandus of Brescia. It is the only one of the
early editions which I do not possess 3 I have had to trust therefore to
the very unskilful collation of Gerard at the end of the Glasgow edition
of Wakefield. As it was printed from a manuscript a good deal
corrected, but yet inferior to such emended copies as the Cambridge
ms. for instance or that which I call Flor. 31, 113 16 of little importance
in the history of the text3 of far less than the two next editions, since
they by accident came to be the foundation of the vulgate. The former
of these was published by Paulus Fridenperger at Verona in 1486

‘die vigesimo octavo septembris calen.octob1is'. It was printed from a
ms closely resembling the one written by Niccoh, as may be seen by
the most cursory inspection of my critical notes. It is therefore very
rude and inaccurate, but being less interpolated than the editio
princeps or the majority of existing mss. it represents the archetype
more faithfully than these do, though there is hardly a line without
some monstrous blunder. The next edition was published in Venice
‘ per theodorum de ragazonibus de asula dictum bresanum’ 4 september
1495. From some elegiae verses at the end one C. Lycinius would ap-

“ pear to be its editor, if editor he can be called 3 for it exactly reproduces

for the most part the Verona edition even in the minutest points of
its perverse punctuation. There are however throughout the poem not
a few differences in the two editions some of little, others of greater
importance3 for example IV 125--191 (190) are wanting in the
Verona, but not in the Venice. The reason why I dwell on this fact
will appear presently.

In December 1500 Aldus published his first edition of our poem,
the first systematic endeavour to make it intelligible throughout. The
editor was Hieronymus Avancius of Verona, who dates his dedication
‘Kalendis Martii. M.1D', old style I presume, and really therefore 1500:
611 interval of twenty-two months between the two dates would not be
easy to understand. Avancius is known by other works also, especially
the Aldine edition of Catullus. A slight inspection will shew that he
took either the Verona or the Venice edition, upon which to form his
text 3 a more careful examination will prove that it must have been the
latter. Our critical notes will furnish many other instances 3 let me
here only mention that in 111 904 he and Ven. have torpedine for cup-
pedine, while Ver. reads turpidine,· 1011 116 takes from Ven. its remark-
able reading eyenus‚w11ich Lachmann adopts and wrongly assigns to
Marullus. Ver. follows the Leyden and all other known mss. in reading
eyesta⁸; 1015 116 and Ven. have the absurd reading numela for Zuella,
where Ver. has the equally unmeaning bida. Ven. therefore is the
‘ante impressus' spoken of by Aldus. Avancius’ preface shews that for
