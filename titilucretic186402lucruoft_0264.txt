eqo nunc nequeo tortos evolvere cursus. 319 firmare for affirmare is
rarely found in good writerS‚ for confirmare frequently in the best and
elsewhere in Lucr. ι 1110 latter may be its meaning here. 322 Ut m'l
inpediat: Epic. in Diog. Lacr. X 135 ταῦτ’ οὖν καὶ τοὶ τούτοις συγγενῆ
μελέτα διδ. παντός...καὶ οὐδέποτ’ οὔθ’ ὕπαρ οὔτ’ ὄναρ διαταραχθήσῃ, ζήσῃ δ’
ὦς θεὸς ἐν ἀνθρώποις· οὐθὲν γὰρ ἔοικε θνητῷ ζῶῳ ζῶν ἅνθρωπος ἐν ἀθανάτοις
ἀγαθοῖς.

323—349: the soul is held together by the body and in turn keeps
the body in life: the one cannot be torn from the other without destruc-
tion to both, any more than its perfume can be separated from frankin-
cense: by their mutual motions sense is kindled: nor 18 1110 body ever
born nor does it grow without the 80111 nor continue when the 80111 1108
left it: even in 1110 mother’s womb they learn in common the motions
of life. 327 Quod yenus, as 266 and 276, introduces an example il-
lustrating both what precedes and what follows. 330 Haut facile est
means of course that it is quite impossible 3 as 361 D‘ffcilest: see n.
there. 332 consorti vita: they are coheirs or copartners of a life,
which is a sor-9, a patrimony or capital, which cannot be divided, but
must be used by them in common: comp. Ciris 14 Si me iam summa
sapientia panqeret arce, Quattuor antiquis quae haeredibus est data con-
80r33 where the arx is the joint sors of the four. 333 Nec sibi quae-
que: suus or sui with which quisque goes so naturally, allows of quaeque
being said of either of two: 80 Cic. pro Rosc. com. 32 suam quisque
partem iuris possideat 3 Livy 11 7 1 ut mete ambo exercitus, Veiens Tar-
quiniensisque, suas quisque abirent domos 3 yet the negative N ec quaeque
for ‘nec utra or nec altera seems harsh. 336 accensus . . sensus: comp.
11 943 and 959. This doctrine of Lucr. that for the production of sense
and life the body is as necessary to the 80111 08 1110 80111 18 10 1110 body 3
that though sensation must begin with the animus and proceed to the
anima before it can extend to the body, and the sense of the 80111 18
more active than that of the body, yet the body feels and lives as well
as the 80111, 18 emphatically declared by Epic. in Diog. Laert. x 63 καὶ
μὴν καὶ ὅτι ἔχει ἦ ψυχὴ τῆς αἰσθήσεως τήν πλείστην αἰτίαν δεῖ κατέχειν. οὗ
μὴν εἰλήφει ἂν ταύτην, εἰ μή aim} τοῦ λοιποῦ ἀθροίσματος ἐστεγάζετό πως·
τὸ δὲ λοιπόν ἄθροισμα παρασκευάσαν τὴν αἰτίαν ταύτην μετείληφε καὶ αὖτὸ
τοιούτου συμπτώματος παρ’ ἐκείνης, οὗ μέντοι πάντων ὧν ἐκείνη κέκτηται; see
this same argument repeated in different words 558-5793 and 0180-
where in this book. 337 Praeterea cet.: this argument is more fully
developed 445—525. 345 Mutua cet.: with this and 558—579 00111.
Epic. 1.1. 64; and with this and much that follows comp. also 65 καὶ μὴν
καὶ διαλυομένου τοῦ ὅλου ἀθροίσματος ἦ ψυχὴ διασπείρεται καὶ οὐκέτι ἔχει
τοὶς αὐτοῖς δυνάμεις οὐδὲ κινεῖται, ὥστ’ οὐδ’ αἴσθησιν κέκτηται. οὗ γὰρ οἷόν τε νοεῖν
αὐτὴν αἰσθανομένην μή ἐν τούτῳ τῷ συστήματι καὶ ταῖς κινήσεσι ταύταις
