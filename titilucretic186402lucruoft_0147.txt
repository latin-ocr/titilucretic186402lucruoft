Cicero, as shewn by Fore. 106 turbare: Wak. compares Aen. XI 400
omnia maqno Ne cessa turbare metu. 107 certam finem. finis is
always fem. in Lucr.: the mss. II 1116 have extremum finem which
Lach. rightly alters. 109 Reziy. often used by Lucr. in the plur. for
religious fears or scruples: he twice has reliqionum nodis eoesolvere,
shewing that he felt reliyio to be connected with reliyare, as does Cic. de
domo 105 nisi etiam muliebribus reliqionibus te implicuisses, though else-
where he wrongly derives it from releqere. 110 restandi common
enough in the poets for resistendi: see Foro. 111 Lach. here and v
302 adds est omitted in mss. because, he says, it cannot be omitted after
the gerund, unless an infin. esse or a compound of vesse follow. I have fol-
lowed him in both places, but with hesitation, as Serv. to Aen. XI 230
quotes our verse without est. Lamb. cites 5 other instances from Lucr.
of this gerundi-al constr.: add V 44 pericula tumst inyratis insinuandum,
and comp. Serv. l. 1. where pacem petendam is read on his authority and
that of other grammarians against the best mss.

113 two theories of the origin of the sou13 the true one that it 18
born with the body, the false that it enters the body at the body’s birth:
114—116 three theories of the soul after death, first the 1166ζο66 that ,
when severed from the body, it dies with it; secondly the false one that
it enters Orcus 3 thirdly the equally false one that it migrates into some
other living creature: Ennius believed in the Pythagorean transmigration
of souls, and therefore in the 2nd and false theory of the soul's origin
' and the 3rd and false one of its migration after death: ann. 10 Ova
parire solet yenu’ pinnis condecoratum, Non animam 3 et post inde venit
divinitu? pullis Ipsa anima. 115 lacunas may mean pools of water,
as v 794, v1 5523 or merely hollows‚ chasms, as apparently VI 538, and
Cic. Arat. 427 Insula discessit disiectaque saxa revellens Perculit et
caecas lustravit luce lacunas. 116 pecudes alias seems clearly a
Grec-ism, like Herod. I 216 θύουσί μιν καὶ ἄλλα πρόβατα ἅμα αὐτῷ, ancl
Empedocles 141 Karsten ἄνθρωποί τε καὶ ἄλλων ἔθνεα θηρῶν. Aen. VI
411 alias animas...Deburbat...simul accipit Aenean. insinuet a very
favourite word of Lucr. with many constructions: either active as here
with two 666118. 066 transit. the other governed by 1116 in (comp. haec
animum advertere), or with one accus. 3 or neut. with an accus. gov. of the
in, or nent. with per: oft. too passive3 once, Iv 1030, followed by an
accus.; elsewhere by a dat. as 113, 01 6 prep. per or in. 117 qui
, primus etc. that is, who first brought to Latium the muses of Helicon
and introduced Greek metres and Greek principles of art: comp. ann.
221 scripsere alii rem Vorsibu' quos olim Faunei vatesque canebant 5
Cwm neque musarum scopulos quisquam superarat Nec dicti studiosus
erat: the mus. scop. being the rocks of Helicon. To this Porcius Licin.
refers ap. Gell. XVII 21 45 Poenico bello secundo musa pinnato yradu
