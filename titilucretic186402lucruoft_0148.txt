seems simply to mean those races of men which are Italian, not unlike
IV 733 Cerbereasque canum facies 3 but see n. to 474 3 and comp. 10 species
verna diei. clueret a favourite archaism of Lucr. = sometimes audio,
sometimes simply sum. Ennius ann. 4, if the reading of Vahlen is right,
speaks even more proudly, Latos per populos terrasque poemata nostra
Clara cluebunt: but this reading is more than doubtful. 120 foll.:
but though he holds this opinion, he yet moreover believes in Acheron,
teaching however that only bloodless idols of the dead dwell there 3 one
of which appeared to him 111 the shape of Homer. 120 Etsi praet.
tam. is somewhat prosaic. Aclaer. templa occms also 111 25, and is found
in Ennf trag. 107 Acherusia templa alta Orci. Lucr. is very fond of the
expression caeli templa with various epithets 3 he has also caelestia and
mundi templa: it is not uncommon in Ennius and others: the phrase
seems evidently adopted from the augural division of the heaven into
templa: hence it conveyed a stately solemn notion 3 and is applied to
Acheron 3 Pla-utus miles 413 has in locis Neptuniis templisque turbu-

lentis: v 103 humanum in pectus templaque mentis 3 IV 624 linquai
templa, where see note.

122 body and 80111 do not hold together and reach this Acheron,
but only pale idols. permaneant seems especially said of the 80111 or
body continuing after death, like διαμένεινε comp. Sext. Emp. adv. math.
IX 72 καὶ καθ’ αὐτοῖς δὲ διαμένουσιν [αἱ ψυχαί], καὶ οὐχ ὦς ἔλεγεν ὅ Ἐπί-
κουρος κ.τ.λ. and 74 εἰ οὖν διαμένουσιν αἱ ψυχαί. Cic. Tusc. disp. 1 108
cera circumlitos condunt ut quam maxime permaneant diuturna corpora:
of the 80111 more than once, as ib. 36 permanere animos arbitramur con-
sensu nationum omnium 3 qua in sede maneant cet: below he quotes a
passage from 811 old tragedian, probably Ennius, to which possibly Luer.
may here refer, Unde animae excitantur obscura umbra, aperto ex ostio
Altae Acheruntis, falso sanquine, mortuoram imagines, as it is read in
Baiter and Halm's ed. It may be said that with Ennius the soul did
not dissolve: that is so 3 but it went into another body and entirely
changed its condition 3 and Ennius no doubt thought of the dissolution

of the old body and soul as complete. With Quo perman. i. 0. usque ad ,

Acher. templa, Lach. compares several passages: Ovid ars 11 120 Solus

ad eaetremos permanet ille royos is perhaps the most in point. 123
Virg. has at least four imitations of this v‚: georg. 1 477 repeats the ’
very words. 124 Ennius ann. 6 Visus Homerus adesse poeta is a. {s-
fragm. of this vision: Cicero more than once infers from these words :³¹2
that it was a dream, not a real vision. 125 the tears were doubtless
in regret for life: Aen. 11 271 Hector seems to weep for his own wounds
and the fall of Troy. ’ 126 expandere = v 54 rerum naturam pandere: 1³
it is a rare word. 127 alludes of course to 54, where I have spoken
