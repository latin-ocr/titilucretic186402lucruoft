‘relatae erant, videretur dubitasse 3 Liv. XXIII 15 4 praemia atque honores,
qui remanserint. . proposuit. 884 lapidi is ab1.: so 1111 de parti,
II 520 mucroni, VI 66 rationi: 866 11. to 978 fini· at least the dat. would
here be very unusual and harsher than the abl. though it may possibly
be the former 3 but comp. Plautus quoted at the end of n. to 887.
885 herbis. . decebat of mss. I now retain3 because decet with a dat. is
common in the old writers 3 see Foro. and comp. Sall. fr. hist. I 98 (100)
locum editiorem quam victoribus decebat [i. e. capere] capit: there is
anyhow a slight anacoL: it should be herbis q. s. d. Et lat. . . et videri 1.6.
herbis 3 but for clearness he adds in 889 herb. qenera cet. so that the Et
of 886 becomes misplaced: as he could not use yeneribus, the change to
the accus. appears quite natural. 887 the constr. is by no means
plain: Lac-h. explains it thus, dulces 9uttas mittere· tales quali oves sunt
¹ ubere lactis, taking therefore laniqerae as the nom plur.: this is surely
harsh with simili sapore coming between yuttas and quali ubere: I am
disposed to take it thus, sapore, quali [sapore guttae] sunt laniyerae
(dat.) [in] ubere lactis 3 but the qualis (nom. plur.) or quales of A and
Nic. N 166. is perhaps right. laniyerae: comp. squamiyeri and penni-
potentes, likewise used absolutely. ub. lac: so 11 370 and Tibullus ubera
lactis 3 Lamb. quotes from Varro mammam lactis. With one exception
the above examples are plain enough: corn should give blood, because we
are fed by it 3 grass milk, because sheep eat it 3 grass earth when pounded
should yield corn leaves, because they grow out of it, wood give smoke
and fire, because they are fed by it: but why the example 111 8841
Lamb. after Turnebus seems to explain it rightly, as denoting another
way of grinding corn3 comp. Plaut. asin. 31 Num me illu-c ducis, ubi
lapis lapidem terit? 895 896 very like 814 815, expressing the
epicurean doctrine of primordia against Anaxagoras as there against
Empedocles. 895 multimodis: see 11. to 683 omnimodis.

897—9202 but you say trees often take fire by rubbing against each
other: true, but for all that fire is not in them 3 else it would burst
forth at any moment: the fact is fire and firs have many first—beginnings
in common, just as the words have letters in common 3 but the two
things, as the two wordS, are yet quite distinct. Again if you think a
thing cannot· be, unless its first-beginnings are of a like nature, then you
must give these human feelingS‚ in order that they may make a man.—
This passage in meaning and in language greatly resembles 803—829:
the reason is plain: the particles of Anaxagoras seemed to Lucr. liable
130 13116 861116 objections as the four elements of EmpedocleS‚ each giving
to his elements those secondary qualities which only belong to things in
being. 900 flam. flore: editors comp. πυρὸς ἄνθος of Homer and Aes-
chylus, and Iv 450 lucernarum florentia lumina flammis. 902 sem.
ardoris, which yet have 110116 whatever of the properties of fire. 904
