venticius habendus est tepor, secl ex intimis maris partibus aqitatione exci-
tatus.. It would agree better with what precedes and follows, as well as
with inqenuei and eaeterna, and 11 590 Uncle mare inmensum . . fontes. .
renovent, if marei could be read: ‘are supplied to the sea’. Oreech in-
, ‹leed, and even Bentl. and Bern. take the acc. mare in this sense: but
· surely Lucr. and every good writer admit an acc. after supp. only of the
thing which is given 3 never of the thing to which it is given. It would
be a smaller departure from the mss. to read marei inqenuei and Zonyo 3
and 1v 741 equi atque makes the elision possible: the position of Zonyo
would then be emphatic, ‘throughout its whole extent’. 231 aetla.
sid. pas: comp. V 524, which mentions this as one of several possible
cases3 though it seems rather stoical than epicurean: comp. too Virg.

’ comic. 97: Lucr. III 650 has abstraoee, v 1159 protraoee3 Virgil traxe,
Horace surrexe, Catullus promisse3 many others, dione and the like, are
found in Plautus: coqnosse remosse cresse in Lucr. are simpler contractioris
like nosse: Ι 987 confluxet: comp. vioeet extinaeem in Virgil, erepsemus in
Horace3 the abundance of such forms in Plautus and the general use of
faxo ausim shew that they belonged to the language of common life.

more fully enforced. 235 haec rerum summa i. e. the whole mundus :

pedita of course agrees with materies: comp. 244. Lamb. here errs as
well as Wak. 241 Madv. Oio. de fin. p. 285 says that satis esset eausa
leti=letum satis efficeret, and that the gen. Zeti makes a difference: in
the passage of Cicero he and Baiter in his new ed. read satis est tibi in
te...praesidii for praesidium. Yet in several passages satis seems to have
the force of an adjective: auctor ad Heren. at beg. vix satis otium studio
suppeditare possumus, where Madvig would read otii 3 ad Att. XII 50 si
satis eonsilium quadam de re haberem, where Lamb. reads consilii.
He also refers to Ovid met. 111 149 Fortunamque dies habuit satis
