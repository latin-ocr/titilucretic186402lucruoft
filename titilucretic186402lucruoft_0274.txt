mind. In our present 86611011 116 shews the reciprocal dependence of
80111 and mind and of body one on the other: 866 what is said of Lach-
mann's punctuation in note 1. The 80111 111118 through the whole body
which depends on it, as much as it depends on the body. There is a
striking resemblance between the language here and that of 323—349 3
only the conclusion proved is different. 558 vivata potestas: 866 409
and 11. 111616. coniuncta is neut. plur. and must refer to potestas twice
repeated ,⁰ yet 116 usually employs the neut. only when the substantives
are of different genders: this case is very exceptional, and harsher than
even 11 400 taetra absinthi natura ferique Centauri foedo pertorquent ora
sapore, where Lach. would prefer pertorqueat. Inter se coniuncta: 332
consorti praedita vita. 560 edere: 11 443 varios quae possint edere
sensus 3 816 variantes edere taetus. 562 sensibus uti, which the 80111
enables it to do by giving birth to sense-giving 1110110118. 564 seorsum
corpore, without a, appears an unusual construction. 569 moventur
motus: a grecism. Epic. in Diog. Laer. x 66 concludes in the same way,
οὗ ’γάρ οἶόν τε νοεῖν αὐτὴν αἰσθανομένην, μὴ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ συστήματι καὶ ταῖς
κινήσεσι ταύταις χρωμένην, ὅταν τοὶ στεγάζοντα καὶ περιέχοντα μή τοιαῦτ’ ᾖ
ἐν οἷς νῦν οὖσα ἔχει ταύτας τοῖς κινήσεις. 573 C'orpus enim cet.: 116 has
shewn again and again that recipi-ocity on the part of the body 18 neces-
sary to enable the 80111 10 begin to act and produce sense. 575 in
ipso corp. 1.6. 1111118 111 corpore: comp. 590, 506, 482 and 11. there.
579 duobus means of course the animus and anima, taken as one, and
the corpus: comp. the conclusion of a very similar argument 348 Ut
videas quoniam coniunctast causa salutis, Coniunctam quoque naturam
consistere eorum, i. e. corporis atque animai.

580-614: when the soul leaves it, the body rots away: a proof
that the 80111 1138 601116 0111 of its inmost depths, 1ο cause such utter
ruin: the 80111 then must have been torn in pieces itself, ere it got out
of the body: often again in life the 80111 8661118 10 fail and be on the
point of going: it is so shattered then together with the body, that a
more violent shock would destroy it: how then could it exist even a
moment, not to say an eternity‚ in the open 3111 3 dying man feels not
the 80111 escaping entire from him, but failing in this spot or that: if the
mind were immortal, it would not mourn its dissolution, but its having
to quit the cover of the body. 581 in tae. od.: Wak. quotes Aen. 111

to odor by Lucr.‚ still oftener to the sense of taste, sometimes to the
sight. in: see n. to 537. 583 utifumus: see Epicurus cited to 456
