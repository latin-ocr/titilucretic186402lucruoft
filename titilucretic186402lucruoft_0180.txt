Phil. p. 67 says that this fire or warm exhalation of Heraclitus is that for
which all things are exchanged, as wares for gold 3 but it changes itself
as little into the things, as gold changes into these wares3 and that
later interpreters misapprehended him. However that be, Lucr. is here
speaking of his followerS, espec. the stoics‚ as remarked above. 648
rarefieri and rarefacere 3 always in Lucr. has e: 8ο vacefit putrefactus
experqefactus, all more than once: confervefacit 3 patefecit and patefiet

a strong tendency to shorten final syllables. 649 super=insuper 3
as 111 672, 901, V 763, VI 514: this sense is found in Virgil: Aen. 1 29,
11 71, v11 462, and I think v 697 Implenturque super puppes, and in
Ovid, as met. ΧΠ 206 Annuerat dederatque super, ne. 653 variantia
found also 111 318 seems to occur only in Lucr. and to be used for varie-
tas for metrical reasons: thus aeqror for aeqritudo, mamimitas for maqni-

differentia, refutatus for refutatio, emissus for emissio, commutatus for
commutati-o, opinatus for opinatio, formatura for conformatio, are con-
fined to him, or to him and his constant imitator Arnobius: satias for
satietas is more general, and impete for impetu 3 but Lucr. has also im-

(299) fuqitant vitantque tueri, and VI 1239. 659 viai belongs to
Ardua also. 662 raptim, like other adverbs in tim, is a favourite of
Lucr. occurring at least 5 times. 665 potesse is found 11 225 and

mutareque: this annexing que to ἔ, which Virgil and Ovid appear wholly ’
