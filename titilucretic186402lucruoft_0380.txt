Pinn. am: Virgil has aliqerum amorem. 1080 in salso: often as
salsus is an epit-het to mare, 9ur9es, fluetus and the like, I do not else-
where find it, as here, used for a subst. 1084 cornicum cet.: Virg.

geor. 1 388 foll. and 410 foll. has some resemblance to this passage.
cornices and corvi are clearly used here with poetical licence, and be-
tween them include the whole crow kind: 9163968 would be singularly
inappropriate to the primary sense of corvi. 1088 bluta, as 1059
pecudes mutae, has its proper force, the uttering inarticulate sounds„

1091—1104: lightning first gave fire to men ; or else the friction of
trees rubbing together: cooking they would learn from the sun, which
they would see softening and ripening things.—— Every one will agree
with Lach. that 1091—1160 are subsequent additions by the poet, of
the same nature as those we have already so often had ; these three
paragraphs have no connexion with the context, either before or after:
1161 Nunc quae naturally follows 1090 3 for at 7 3 he promised to dis-
cuss the question of the gods immediately after that of the invention of
speech: again in this our present passage he speaks of the first discovery
of fire, though 1011 it was already in general use: again 1105-1160
116 mentions cities kings magistrates laws, though not till 1361 does he
treat of the beginning of agriculture3 and then 1440 he speaks of for-
tresses and the division of landS, though above 1108 all this and much
more was assumed. 1091 tacitus has much the same force it has
Hor. sat. 1 3 65 ut forte leyentem Aut tacitum impellat quovis sermone
molestu33 epist. 1 4 4 tacitum silvas inter reptare salubres ,· 11 2 >145
mecum loquor baec tacitusque recordor: it is then almost the same as
tecum. 1095 Fulyere: see n. to 11 41 Fert-ere. 1096 Et tamen: see
1125 and n. to 1 1050. 1097 Aestuat of the swaying movement of a
tree in the wind is natural enough3 not unlike Catul. xxv 12 Et inso-
lenter aestues velut minuta maqno Deprensa navis in mari, 01 Cic. Verr.
11 74 aestuabat dubitatione, versabat se in utramque partem non solum
mente, verum etiarn corpore: the sense of ‘grows hot’ seems not so
suitable here, as that is an after result.

1105—1135: every day men of genius invented improved methods
of life: cities were built, lands and cattle allotted at first according to
merit 3 but soon the discovery of gold gave all power to the wealthy:
men would not learn how little was needed for happiness3 they there-
fore sacrificed everything for power and eminence, often when they had
reached the summit, only to be again dashed down: let men thus struggle
on along the path of ambition, since they have no true enjoyment, being
really the slaves of their own dependents. 1107 corde: cor habere was
a common phrase: see Foro. 1111 facie = 1116 pulchro corpore, and
means personal appearance, εἶδος, generally. 1117 yubernet is poten-
tial. 1118 foll. as Epicurus himself so often inculcates: Diog. Laer.
