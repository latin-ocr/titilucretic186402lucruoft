INTRonucTION 2 3

which Lachmann follows in his edition: where spurious vss. of the mss.
310 omitted from the text, 110 still allows them to count. For obvious
reasons I have followed him in this, as 110 will be the future standard
of comparison, and there is great advantage in a uniform numbering of
the verses.

Since many special questions of orthography are noticed as they
occur in the notes, I should have thought it unneces'sary to say more in
this place than that in essential points I follow Lachmann, if it were
not for the apparent unwillingness of scholars in this country to accept
even the smallest change in what they look upon as the usual or con—
ventional 111108 of spelling. The notion of any uniform conventional
spelling is quite a chimera: I never find two English editors following
any uniform system3 nay the same editor will often differ in different
parts of the same book. But whence 0011108 11118 ‘ conventional' system,
so far as it does exist? from the meritorious and considering their
position most successful endeavours of the Italian scholars in the
fifteenth century to get rid of the frightful mass of barbarisms which
the four or five preceding centuries had accumulated. They sought
indeed to introduce rigorous uniformity in cases where variety was the
rule of the ancients, and though these cases embraced only a few
general heads, they yet comprised a great multiplicity of particular
instances, because involving the terminations of cases, the assimilation
of prepositions in compound verbs and the like. But where there was
only one right course, they generally chose it3 yet from the utter
confusion into which the use of the aspirate had fallen, their own
language having entirely lost it in sound, but at this time retained it in
spelling3 from the almost complete identity both in sound and writing
of c and t, and the like, they never could tell whether humor or umor,
humerus or umerus, spatium or spacium, species or speties was correct 3
and consequently as a rule chose the wrong. Their general principles
however were not accepted by the most thoughtful scholars in any age,
80 far at least as concerned the text of ancient authors, unless it be
during a part of the present century 3 neither by an Avancius in the
l5th nor by a Lambinus or Scaliger in the 16th nor by a Gronovius in
the 17 th nor by a Bentley in the 18th. Yet this system gradually
established itself, because it came to be used by scholars in their own
writings, some of the barbarisms being gradually eliminated3 new ones
however being introduced, such as coelum coena moereo sylva caetera for
caelum cena ‘maereo silva cetera in order to derive them preposterously
from Greek words.

Many attempts were made in various directions to change this state
of things ε 1110 best and most systematic was that of Ph. Wagner in his
orthographia Vergiliana published in 1841. With admirable industry
he amassed all the evidence afforded by the medicean and, 80 far as it
was accessible to him, of the other ancient mss. of Virgil. As these,
like other old mss. are as a rule very tenacious of the true spelling in
those cases where there is only one right method, he performed this part
of his work with eminent success, and still remains one of the best
authorities 011 1110 subject. In those other cases however alluded to
above, in which variety is the rule of the ancieuts and which include a
