288 Eoeaequat spatium lucis cum tempore noctis, 281 rota fervida solis,
282 brumali tempore flexus, 249 fulyens candore notatur, 250 conficit
orbem, 252 caeli lustrare cavernas. It is quite evident Lucr. had care-
fully studied this translation of Cicero ,- other parts of which are imitated
in other parts of 1118 poem.

621 vel cum primis, as if this seemed the most plausible theory,
where all must be uncertain. 622 = 111 371. 624 cum caeli tur-
bine: 510 maynus caeli si vortitur orbis 3 which Lucr. also appears to
think most probable. 625 Evanescere, I mminui: comp. 535 Evanes-
cere, et decrescere, and see n. there. 627 cum poster. siff: it is over-
taken and passed by one sign of the zodiac after another and thus left
with the hinder ones, which pass it in turn, until the whole zodiac has
gone by it in the opposite direction to that in which it has appeared to
go through the zodiac. 628 fervida siqua i.e. of the zodiac which
are higher and therefore carried on in more rapid revolution. 629
mcoyis lcoc i.e. lunam magis quam hune relinqui. 631 tendere cursum
seems to be no more than tendere iter, or cursu. tendere, which Sallust
and Virgil use: Livy xxm 34 5 has tendere cursum and Virg. Aen v
834 con-bendere cursum for a ship keeping on its course. 632 fertur
cet. ε 116 now passes to the oratio recta, which he had partially adopted
in 630 abest, propinquat. 636 ad hanc revisunt: 11 359 revisit Ad
stabulum, where see note. I do not find Democritus’ name elsewhere
attached to this theory: Geminus elem. astr. 10, though he condemns it,
gives a lucid account of it: λέγουσί τινες, 116 says3 and he illustrates it
by this compat-ison ε if twelve 1111111618 are going round in a circle at the
same pace and a thirteenth is going the same round at a slower pace, he
will appear to be running through those behind him, while in truth
they are all passing him: the sun or the moon is this thirteenth3 the
twelve runners the signs of the zodiac which are really passing the 81111
and moon, while these seem to be going through them in the contrary

direction. 637 aer. . . alter cet. i. e. duo aeres, alter Qui queat aestivis
cet. alter qui reiciat. 641 friqoris uwtbris: Wak. quotes Virg. geor.
111 357 Tum sol pallentis haut umquam discutit umbras. 644 Quae

volvunt cet. refers of course only to stellas: Lucr. imitates Cicero quoted
above. volvunt armos i.e. volvendo faciunt: Cicero less poetically Haec
[Hae] faciunt maynos lonqinqui temporis annos: Aratus himself 458
Μακροὶ δὲ σφέων εἰσὶν ἑλισσομένων ἐνιαυτοί. 647 supernis dat. gov. by
diversas: Hor. epist. 1 18 5 Est huic diversum vitio vitium: it is a very
common kind of conciseness of expression for in partis contrarias iis
partibus ire. quas superna eunt, and resembles 111 1038 eadem aliis sopitu'
quietesc and the like. 649 sidera here, as above 623, means all the
heavenly bodies, sun moon planets fixed stars.
