Lach. unskilfully changes the reading. 386 Tantum is the accus·

foll. though they generally contend on equal terms, yet each has once
been victorious. superantior seems a ἅπαξ λεγόμ. : see n. to IV 961
divisior, distractior. 396 superat is the perfi: see n. to 1 70 Inritat
animi and 111 1042 obit. 39¹7 Avia: Ovid met. 11 167 ruunt tritum-

begins the description of Jupiter striking a man with lightning3 in
Ovid it is, as here, Phaeton: Aen. vn 770 Tum pater omnipotens ali-
quem ineliqnatus cet. in like manner introduces the account of his
striking down Fulmine Phoebiqenam. 400 repenti: there seems to be
no other example of this adj. except in the form repens. 402 aeter-

is much enfeebled by his unsatisfactory allegorizing’: but this moral-
ising is the very condition of the existence of such passages as that

written them 3 and to my mind it is extremely interesting to see his
intense love of these seductive fancies and the struggle between his
instinct as a poet and his philosophical principles. 409 revictae :per-

re may here have its proper force. 410 exustae tor. auris: Pacuvius

of this v. as rightly read in the mss. ‘ita autem ignem superare posse, ut

ning of this very passage 382 Nonne vides aliquam lonyi certaminis ollis
Posse clarifinem? vel cum sol cet.
