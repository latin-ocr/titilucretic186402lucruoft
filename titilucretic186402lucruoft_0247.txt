ber without any substantive seems very unusual. 1043 Dede manus:
da manus is the usual expression. With what precedes comp. the very
similar language of the stoic in Cic. de nat. deor. ΙΙ 96 quod si boc
idem εει) aeternis tenebris continqeret ut subito lucem aspiceremus, quae·
nam species caeli videretur? sed adsiduitate cotidana et consuetudine
oculorum adsuescunt animi neque admirantur neque requirunt rationes
earum rerum quas semper vident, proinde quasi novitas nos mayis quam
maqnitudo rerum debeat ad eoequirendas causas excitare 3 yet just above
he says of Lucr. and his school certe ita temere de mundo effutiunt, ut
mihi quidem numquam hunc admirabilem caeli ornatum. ‚suspexisse vi-
deantur: such different conclusibns may be drawn from the same phae-
nomena. 1047 animi iactus: see n. to 740 animi iniectus 3 and
comp. Oic. de nat. deor. 1'54 euius [dei] operam projecto non desidera-
retis, si inmensam et interminatam in omnis partis maynitudinem reqio-
num videretis, in quam se iniciens animus et intendens ita late lonqeque
pereyrinatur ut nullam tamen oram ultimi videat in qua possit insistere.
The argument could dispense with these last four vss. and their style
appears to me to have something constrained in it. I am disposed to
look upon them as one of those subsequent additions of the poet, of
which I have spoken above p. 22, and elsewhere.

1048—1066: space then being unlimited on all sides and atoms in-
finite in number, it is not likely this world should be the only one in
being, since it was formed by a mere chance combination of atoms: there
are then in other parts of space other like combinations of matter.
1050 res ipsaque: Lucr. often has que in the third place, not only with
prepositions and their caseS, even dissyllabic prepos. as V 1205 super
stellisque 3 but in other instances, as here and 48, 111 662, 962, IV 79,
104, 273, 824, 1010, v 680, VI 957, 1007, 1085; Virgil only with
monosyl. prepos. and their cases and with iamque namque according to
Wagner geor. 1 142: 11 1099 Lucr. has ve too in the third place, Omnibus
inve locis. 1051 elucet thus coupled by a simple et with docui and
vociferatur is somewhat awkward: one would have Α expected a word
meaning to make clear. 1053 Undique vorsum: 188 Sursus enim
versus: see Forc. for similar instances from Cicero Caesar and the best
writers3 deorsum versus, utroque vorsum, quoquoversus and the like:
Gellius 5111 13 20 has undique versum. 1054 innumero numero: 1086
sed numero maqis innumerali 3 ΙΙΙ 7 7 8 Expectare immortalis mortalia mem-
bra Innumero numero 3 VI 485 I nnumerabilem enim numerum 3 Plautus in
his own epitaph E't numeri innumeri simul omnes collacrumarunt, which
Ritschl parergon p. 42 refers to the great variety of Plautus’ metres: in
number numberless and numbers numberless are common ,in our old
writers: not unlike are innuptae nuptiae, mentes dementes, iniustaque
iusta of other poets 3 and similar in effect are 1 98 casta inceste, 111 869
