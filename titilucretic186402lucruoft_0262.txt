Lucr. and to this book. 242 east omnino nominis expers and 279
nominis haec ewpers vis express the ἀκατονόμαστον of Plutarch and Sto-
baeus: the latter continues 1. l. τό δ’ ἀκατονόμαστον τὴν ἐν ἡμῖν ἐμποιεῖν

Plut. adv. Col. 20 says τὸ γὰρ ᾧ κρίνει καὶ μνημονεύει καὶ φιλεῖ καὶ μισεῖ

ἐπιγίνεσθαιε this fourth nameless thing must have been restricted to the
central animus 3 the anima must have shared with it the other three:
perhaps Epicurus got the notion of this τετάρτη οὐσία or quartessence
from the quintessence of Aristotle. 24¹7 venti here and below takes
1110 place of the aura of 232 and 290: its effects are described below 3
but how far this ventus aura or πνεῦμα differed in substance from his
aer is not stated. 250 postremis. . ossibus: 800 11. to 11 217 and 1080,

257: it must surely have been a misapprehension of some statement of
Epicurus similar to this that led to the strange assertion in Plut. de
plac. phil. 1v 23 that Epicurus placed καὶ τοὶ πάθη καὶ τοῖς αἰσθήσεις ἐν
Τοῖς πεπῠνθόσι Τόποίς· Τὸ ’γὰρ ἡγεμονικόν ἀπαθές-

258-322 : these four substances have their elements so mixed to-
gether as to make up a single whole 3 just as in the flesh of any animal
there are different substances, which yet compose a single body: the
fourth nameless substance, the first source of sensation, lurks in the in-
most recesses of the body and is so to speak the soul’s soul, being to the
soul what the soul 18 to the body, and supreme over both. Thus too the
three other substances must be so mixed up as 130 form one whole, lest
their several powers acting independently should destroy sensation:
every animal has 111 113 13110 heat the spirit and the air, but one animal
has more of one than of the other, and thus gets its distinctive character:

the lion has more of heat, the stag of spirit or wind, the ox of air ε 80 18 2-
it with men 3 their characters differ as they have more of one or of an-
other of these : yet reason will so keep down the too great influence of
any of them, that a wise man may live like a god. 259 Compta: see Ϊ·
