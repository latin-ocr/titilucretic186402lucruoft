frequenter et compluribus locis nunc flammas, ‘nunc vaporem, nunc fa-
mum eructet. inde denique Aetnae montis per tob saecula durat incen-
dium, et ubi acrior per spiramenta cavernarum ventus incubuit, hare-
narum moles eyeruntur...eadem causa etiam Aetnae ruentis perpetuos

penitus, a favourite assonance: 1 529 penitus penetrata retexi 3 11 539
U t penitus nequeat penetrari: Lachmann's remark ‘hoc enim [penam]
ad penetrare pertinere non est veri simile’ strikes me as very strange3
as well as the union of confidence and ill-success with which he treats
. the whole passage. 700 arenae: comp. J ustin and Seneca quoted
above. Lucr. shews here his habitual accuracy of observation and
vividness of description: all the principal features of au eruption are
brought into clear relies. Virg. geor. 111 241 niqramque alce subiectat
harenam with a quite different application. '701 crateres gives a.
lively picture of the thing, which neither fauces nor ora does.

703—711: in the case of many things you must state several causes,
to be sure of including the actual cause: for instance if γοα 566 3 dead
body at some distance, you may have to suggest this and that cause,
though you are sure only one has occasioned the death—Such an intro-
duction 136 3 561165 of cases which admit of more than one explanation 15,

to Pythocles‚ very characteristical of this philosophy: τὸ δὲ μίαν αἶἰἕίαν
τούτων ἀποδιδόναι, πλεοναχῶς τῶν φαινομένων ἐκκαλουμένων, μανικόν κ. τ. λ.

53γ5 Epic. 1.1. 113. ¹704 satis est can hardly in sense apply to pluris:
opus est or the like seems to be required. una tamen sit 1. 6. 63α53,
though you are 11013 able to determine it. '70¹7 una, compared with

704 una, appears 130 be 13116 adjective: ut dicatur una causa leti illius
hominis: the ellipse is harsh anyhow, and it might be simpler to take
una as the adverb, that among these various causes the cause of his
death may be stated. '710 qenere ex Ῐιοσ, 13116 whole class of causes of
death.

712—'737 : the Nile may rise from various causes: from the etesian
winds blowing up the stream and stopping the waters: or from sand 36-
cumulating at the mouth: or perhaps rather from the 131115 313 1135 source
caused by these winds collecting the clouds there against the high moun-
tains: or from snow melting on the lofty Ethiopian hills. '712 in
aestatem=aestatez 875 in lucem tremulo rarescit ab aestu: the usage
seems to be archaic: Plaut. Bacch. 130 M agyis unam in memtemsc (2)
