because the sun continuing the same chooses to run in unequal curves
above and below the horizon, his course above being as much more or
less than a semicircle, as his course below is less or more, until at each
equinox the two are equal: all this you may see marked on a map of
heaven: or else the air is denser in some parts than in others, so that 116
travels more slowly through the former 3 and thus the winter nights are
longer: or else a new sun is always born, and in successive parts of the
year his fires collect more or less quickly and so rise in particular
quarters.—Again three courses are open to you'r choice‚ the first most
resembling the theory of vulgar philosophers. 681 cum sumant: see
n. to 11 41 cum videas. 682 sol idem, as 658. 683 amfractibus:
this word is used by Cicero more than once for the annual course of the
sun: see F orc.: but Lucr. here employs it for the unequal daily curves
it makes above and below the horizon: amsa: 1 718 anfractibus with u.
686 relatus: if the other part is from east to west, relatus expresses the
return from west to east. 687 anni Noclus must here mean 13116 inter-
section of the ecliptic and equator at 13116 two equinoxes, though nodus
in astronomica-l Latin and σύνδεσμος 111 Greek have also other meanings :
Cic. Arat. 2 87 I u quo autumnali atque iterum sol lumine veruo Eaeaequat
spatium lucis eum tempore noctis. 689 cursu i. e. solis. medio governs
flatus: Cic. in his Aratea often has aurae aquilonia austri, and. the like
to denote the point from which the wind blows, as Lucr. here uses
¹ flatus: 280 a clarisonis auris aquilonis acl austrum Cedens, 272 ab in-
seruis austri convertitur auris, 253 Quorum alter tauqens aquilonis
vertitur auras: Lucr. has probably taken the notion from him. When
the sun is midway between the two solstices, the heaven Distinet aeq.
discr. metas: 617 Cancri metas solstitiales was the tropic of cancer 3 and
it would be natural therefore to take metas here for the two tropics, as
editors have generally done. But the sentence is then a sheer truism,
when the sun is midway between the tropics 116 16 midway between
them. Lucr. has been speaking of the inequality of day and night and
accounting for it by the path of the sun, imparibus curreres amfractibus,
in partis nou aequas dividit orbem, until armi Nodus nocturnas exaequat
lucibus umbras: here too I take him to be speaking of the daily revolu-
tion of the sun, when day and night are equal. metas can of course be
used for the points where he rises and sets ,· 66 Ovid met. 111 145 Et sol
ex aequo meta distabat utraque: the heaven keeps his two goals‚ the
points where he rises and sets, at an equal distance from north and
south, i. e. speaking roughly he rises and sets due east and west. 690
aequato discr: he no longer in partis ozon aequas dividit orbem. 691
siqu. orbis: Cic. Arat. 317 Zodiacum hunc Graeci vocitarit nostrique
Latini Orbem siqoiiferum perhibebunt nomine vero: the same name he
and others give to itin prose as well: 712 εἱφωνιωη per orbem. 692
