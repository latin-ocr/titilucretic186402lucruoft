progn. 8 μέγα δὲ σῖναπνεόμενον [πνεῦμα] καὶ διοὶ πολλοῦ χρόνου παραφροσύ-
νην δηλοῖ. 1187 Sudoris...per collum: Hippocr. progn. 9 mentions
sweats on the head and neck only as very bad, and adds οἱ δὲ κεγχροειδέες
καὶ μοῦνον περὶ τὸν τράχηλον γινόμενοι πονηροί : the latest editor Ermerins
omits these words because Galen says some mss. want them: Lucr. was
less critical. 1188 croci cet.: Hippocr. 1.1. 24 τό τε γὰρ ξανθὸν
[πτύελον] ἄκρητον ε’ὃν κινδυνῶδες, and elsewhere speaks of saltness of spittle
as a dangerous symptom. 1190 In manibus cet: Hippocr. 1. l, 7
mentions at length nervous twitchings of the hands, κροκίδας ἀπὸ τῶν
ἱματίων οἷποτιλλούσας, and the like, as deadly symptoms; but this
‘ fumbling with the sheets and playing with flowers' and the like have
ever been noted as sure signs of death. trahere: see 11. to 595 movere:
Lach. says the trahere for trahi is admissible, when the act is involuntary
and there is no external and apparent cause for the contraction. tremere
artus: this shivering Hippocr. mentions as a bad sign in sever. 1191
‘ they were as cold as any stone 3 then I felt to his knees, and so upward,
and all was cold as any stone'. 1192 Non dab. : IV 188 Non dubitant
transire ; VI 1072 aquai fontibus audent M isceri. item ad supremum
cet.: these signs of approaching death seem almost translated from
Hippocr. progn. 2 ῥὶς ὀξεῖα, ὀφθαλμοὶ κοῖλοι, κρόταφοι ξυμπεπτωκότες...καὶ
‘td δέρμα τὸ περὶ ‘ro μέτωπον σκληρόν τε καὶ περιτεταμένον καὶ καρφαλέον
ε’όν; 111686 words recur little changed in the praen. Goacae: Celsus 11 6
translates him thus ‘ ad ultima vero ’ἱανι rentum esse testantur nares
acutae, collapsa tempora, oculi concavi,...cutis circa frontem dura et in-
tenta. 1193 nasi acumen: his 11036 was as sharp as a pen. 1195 in
ore trucei rictum, another well-marked symptom: 2 Η611. vl 3 3 24
See how the panys of death do ‘make him 9rin; par. lost 11 845 and death
Grinnd horrible a qastly smile. 1196 Nec m'mio post: see 11. to v
988 Nec nimio plus. riqidi mor. iaaz you can say vir iacet merita
morte i.e cecidit or occisus est mer. morte: thus Odyss. α 46 Καὶ λίην
κεῖνός γε ἐοικότι κεῖται ὀλέθρῳ, which Ovid fasti 111 707 translates Morte
iacent merita3 but scarcely arcus iacent riyicla morte: this a Lambinus
and Lachmann felt instinctively‚ a Wakefield never could feel.

1197 Octavo cet.: 116 now returns to Thuc. who says 49 8 ὥστε ἢ
διεφθείροντο οἱ πλείους ἐναταῖοι καὶ ἑβδομαῖοι κ.τ.λ. meaning of' course
that the seventh and the ninth were the two critical days: the sad
necessity os the metre I fear has caused Lucr. thus seriously to vary the
statement. 1198 lampade: see n. to v 402 lampada. 1199 fun.
leti: 111 42 Tartara leci. 1200 niqra proluvie alvi· is the διαρροίας
