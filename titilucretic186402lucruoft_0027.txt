INTRODUCTION 9

found 011 him at his death. If now all that is common to the first
Aldine and the J untine comes from MaruIIUS‚ as Lachmann: maintains,
surely Candidus must have been struck with this coincidence, and would
have recorded it against Avancius, the editor of the great rival pub-
lisher. Yet Avancius did borrow largely, very largely from Marullus
especially in the case of interpolated verses 111 ade by the latter. How
is this to be explained? Evidently even before his death, Marullus’
labours on Lucretius were known 3 and probably there was more than
one copy of these, the one not always agreeing w'ith the other. On this
point compare notes 1 to 1 551—628, where Candidus makes some per-
verse transpositions of verses, 011 the authority of Marullus he says 111
his note at the end ; but the learned annotator of one of the Laurentian
mss. states that some put 551—564 after 576, and adds ‘ verum Marullo
parum referre videtur quomodo legatur’. This annotator and Avancius
Pius Candidus Grifanius can hardly all have had the same copy: per-
haps all were different. Avancius then may have had his notes in the
very copy of Ven. 011 which he formed his text: he may have hardly
known to whom they belonged 3 and may have looked on them as pub-
lic property which he might make use of without acknowledgment
according to the practice of the time, for neither Pius nor Candidus
acknowledges in his turn what he got from Avancius ; nor does N auge-
rius the editor of Ald. 2 say a syllable of ‚Candidus whose edition 110
copied with few variations.

But Lachmann to 111 98 cites in proof of his charge that Avancius
was a dishonest plagiary three interpolated verses which doubtless were
composed by Marullus and are corruptly given in Ald. l. In notes 1 to
111 98 I have attempted to shew from Gifanius that Marullus probably
wrote putarit, and that Avancius intended to read the same: Avancius
was probably as good a Latin scholar as Marullus, if less versed in Lu-
cretius. In the line inserted after 1v 102 multae for multas may be an
error of the printer 01· an oversight of Avancius. In that inserted after
1v 532 there can be little doubt that he purposely wrote suis, imagining
that oris was a plural. The correcting of texts was then in its infancy‚
and Avancius had so grievous a task before him in making sense out of
the monstrously corrupted Venice edition, that much must in fairness
be excused: we cannot tell what were the exact relations between him
and Aldus and his printers. At the end of his Catullus published two
years later he has taken occasion to give four pages of Lucretian criti-
cism, in which he has proposed many excellent alterations of his former
text, though I do not find that any editor before me has noticed these
which are very important for his reputa-tion: see notes 1 to 11 422 and
many other passages. The inference then I draw from all this is that
both Avancius and Marullus did much for Lucretius, Marullus doubtless
more than Avancius 3 that much which is peculiar to the Juntine is not
from Μαι-1111118, and much of what Marullus did, is not in the J untine.
Between them they vastly improved a grievously corrupt text 3 and
though they introduced many perversities, we ought in simple justice to
take into consideration only what is good. In my notes for obvious
reasons, when Ald. l and J unt, agree in a reading, I mention both 3
when a reading is peculiar to Ald. l, I assign it to Avancius by name 5
