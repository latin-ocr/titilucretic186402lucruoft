16 NorEs 1

order to illustrate Lucretius through them and them by Lucretius, and
the Latin language by all. He had an almost unequalled power of
grasping a subject in its widest extent and filling up the minutest de—
tails. One mark of a great original critic, which eminently belongs to
Lachmann, is this: even when wrong, 116 puts into your hands the best
weapons for refuting himself, and by going astray makes the right path
easier for others to find. Another test is this, when his influence extends
far beyond his immediate author. Now hardly any work of merit has
appeared in Germany since Lachmann's Lucretius in any branch of
Latin literature without bearing on every page the impress of his ex-
ample. When he is better known in England, the same result will
follow here. Though his Latin style is eminently clear lively and ap-
propriate, yet from his aim never to throw away words, as well as· from

a mental peculiarity of his, that he only cared to be understood by those⁴

whom he thought worthy to understand him, he 18 often obscure and
oracular on a first reading. Had his commentary been twice the length
it is, it would have been easier to master. But when once fully appre-
hended his words are not soon forgotten. His love for merit of all
kinds incites in him a zeal to do justice to all the old scholars who have
done anything for 1118 author, while his honest scorn and hatred of
boastful ignorance and ignoble sloth compel him to denounce those whom
116 convicts of these offences. In one instance, that of Forbiger‚· this
sterness passes into ferocity: most of his errors that scholar could hardly
avoid in the circumstances in which he was placed.

Old Hermann warns us, when we disagree with Lachmann, to think
twice lest we, not he, be in fault. His defects however must not be
passed over. While the most essentia] part of his work, the collation of
the two Leyden 11188, 1168 been performed with admirable skill and
industry, he has not been so happy in the use of secondary evidence,
that of the Italian mss. and the older editions. Much he has taken on
trust on insufficient evidence, and much that he had before him he has
not always accurately used. Some proofs of this have been given, more
will be seen below. But a still more serious defect must be told: he
meant his book to be a critical revision of the text, and left to others
the task of explaining and illustratingv the meaning. So far good τ but
as the text of an author in the condition of that of Lucretius cannot
be always rightly constructed without a sufficient knowledge of his
system and its literature, he has not unfrequently strangely blundered
and grossly corrupted the poet’s words: for examples of this see 1 599-
634 11 522—529 1010 foll. v 513—516. His consummate knowledge
of the Latin language as well as of the manner of Lucretius in parti·
cular enables him often to emend his author with great success. As
he wishes too to produce, where it is possible, an intelligible text,
many of his corrections he must himself have looked upon as only
provisional. Yet his greatest admirers must concede that he has not
Madvig’s ‘curiosa felicitas' in emendation. He has however achieved
a work which will be a landmark for scholars as long as the Latin
language continues to be studied‚ a work, peofidiae quod post nulla
arquet aeta-9.

Jacob Bernays in 1852 edited a text of Lucretius for the Teubner·
