the first philosophy yet in its infancy, as may be seen a few pages
later in the last chap of metaph. 13 and we learn from Diog. Laert.
VIII 57 that Aristotle recognised his poetical genius, ἐν δὲ τῷ περὶ
ποιητῶν φησιν ὅτι καὶ Ὁμηρικός ὅ Ἐμπεδοκλῆς καὶ δεινὸς περὶ τήν φράσιν
γέγονε, μεταφορικός τ’ ὢν καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις τοῖς περὶ ποιητικὴν ἐπιτεύγμασι
χρώμενος.

'7 34—'762 : he and the others have given responses truer than those
of Phoebus 3 yet all alike have gone to wreck on the first-beginnings of
things: they deny a void in things, yet give them motion and leave them
soft and rare3 and they set no limit to the division of things: if first-
beginnings are soft, they were born and will die 3 all things therefore have
come from ancl will return to nothing: again such elements are hostile
one to the other 3 and thus, like lightning clouds winds, will be apt to fly
asunder one from the other rather than combine, '734 supra, '7 05 foll.:

with multis: IV 342 multis partibus hic est Mobilior multisque minutior 3
Caes de bel. civ. 111 84 ozunoero multis partibus esset inferior: Cicero
uses omnibus partibus with much the same force, which eyreyie multis
has here: see Madv. de fin. p. 328. '7 3¹7 adyto cordis of course with
reference to the illustration which follows: Ov. met. XV 145 auyustae
reserabo oracula mentis. '738 Lucr. was prob. thinking of Gallim. in
Del. 94 where Apollo says Ἀλλ’ ἔμπης ἐρέω τι τορώτερον ἢ οἶπὸ δάφνης.
739 t Aristoph. Plut. 39 τί δῆτα Φοῖβος ἔλακεν ἐκ τῶν στεμμάτων, taken
with Eur. Or. 321 τρίποδος ἄπο φάτιν, ἂν ὁ Φοῖβος ἔλακεν ἔλακε and Iph.
Taur. 951 Ἐντεῦθεν αὐδὴν τρίποδος ἐκ χρυσοῦ λακῶν, exactly expresses
the v. of Lucr. who translates the oracular ἔλακεν by profatur. To con-
sult the oracle, you passed through the temple into the μέγαρον or room
built of five stones: still farther in was the cavern, forming the ἄδυτον or
χρηστήριονε in it just over a deep narrow cleft was placed the tripod 3 on
the tripod the λέβης or cortina or pot, in shape a half-sphere: its lid was
the ὅλμος or hollow cover on which the Pythia sat 3 all round were sus-
pended garlands of the hay-laurei: the smell of these was supposed to in-
crease the prophetie afflatus, excited by the cold air which came out of the
deep cleft: they are the στέμματα of Aristophanes, the δάφνη of Callima-
chus, the laurus of Lucr.: to them Pind. ol. VII 32 alludes in εὐώδεος ἐξ οἶδύ-
του. '738 '739 recur v 111 112 : with the abl. tripodi Lach. compares 11
416 Cilici, 111 132 Heliconi. '740 fec. ruinas: metaphor from a build-
ing or other heavy body falling 3 perhaps from a carriage breaking down:
Horace has the same expression: Lucr. uses more than once the more com-
mon dwre ruinas: see n. to IV 41 dicessum dederint : Cic. de fin. 1 18 applies
the same metaphor to Epicurus himself, illae Epicuri propriae ruinae 3
