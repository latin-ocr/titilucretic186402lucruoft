they have their usual sense 3 and in that case a verse must be lost here,
such as Corpora quae constant nullo coniuncta colore. '749 Omnis,
omnino, in omnis. 7 51-754=1 7 90-7 93. '755 continyas: see

757-787 : again if atoms have no colour, but beget any colour by
their different shapes positions motions and the like, you can explain
change of colour: thus the green sea becomes white: why? by its ele-
ments changing their order, and by some going, others coming: but
green elements could not become white. But if you say they have dif-
ferent colours, then you should see in the one colour of the sea others
quite different mixed up, as in a square composed of various shapes
you see these shapes: again these shapes do not prevent the whole ex-
terior being square, but different colours would prevent a thing being
of one colour. 757 foll. : with this and with what precedes and follows
comp. what Plut. adv. Golot. 7 cites from the 2nd book of Epicurus
against Theophrastus: colours are not συμφυῆ τοῖς σώμασιν, ἀλλὰ γεν-

extra, on the outside‚ opposed to what is intus, seems quite to suit the
meaning: comp. Varro de re rust. 111 16 16 vitiles fimo bubulo oblinunt

788—794: we are tempted to give to atoms colour, not knowing
how colour otherwise can come ε but we have seen that white can come
from what is not white 3 and surely white can arise more easily from
no colour, than for instance from black: this reason then falls to the
ground. 790 quoniam, as seen in the last paragraph. '791 cluent

795—816: again colours cannot exist without light, atoms never
come into the light, therefore atoms have no colour: what colour can .
there be in darkness, when we see that the same thing continually
changes its colour in different lights‘e as therefore it is such and such
stroke of light which produces such and such colour, without that
stroke they cannot exist: as too one stroke produces white, another
black, and as a stroke is a touch, and as it is shape, not colour which af-
fects touch, atoms need not colour, but different shapes to give different
touches. 795 foll. Lucretius' syllogism is quite correct 3 it is Lam-
binus’ which is in fault, who quite misstates the poet's minor premiss.
