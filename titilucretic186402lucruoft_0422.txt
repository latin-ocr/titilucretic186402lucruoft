404 NOTES ΙΙ

1048 Aere interp. cet.: Lucr. is here completely mistaken from too
hasty an induction: neither the attractive nor the repulsive power of a
magnet is sensibly affected by the interposition of any body which is
not sensibly magnetical, be it metal glass wood paper or whatever else:
nay the magnet works equally in a vacuum, the absence or presence of
air making no difference: this by the way overthrows the poet’s argu-
ment 1022-1041, where he brings in his favourite air to assist in ex-
plaining the attraction between the loadstone and iron. But is Lucr.
has failed in solving the mystery, no one seems to have succeeded.
1050 Praecepit: 803 uisi aquam praecepimus ante. 1053 fluctu is
the same as the aestus of 1051 1056 and 1059, and the flumine of
1064. 1054 respuit and 1055 resorbet appear to be used in designed
contrast. 1056—1064 I have joined with what precedeS, as mani-
festly belonging to the same argument, the repulsive power of the mag÷
net through aes: comp. 1063 Aeris ubi cet. : this is shewn too by 1057
impellere, 1060 inpellier, which imply driving from, not drawing to:
the purpose of these lines is plainly this : he has shewn above why iron
is attracted and not other metals: if now it is repelled in the way
stated, it might be thought that other substances which cannot be at-
tracted, would a fortiori be repelled where iron is repelled: this in-
ference he attempts to obviate in these vss. by asserting that gold is
too heavy, wood too porcus. 1057 impellere to push on and so repel.
1058 stant ε Lach. p. 85 compares 11 181 and v 199 tanta stat praedita
culpa, where stat = est 3 but here stant seems to have its proper force of
standing still, the opposite of impelli. 1059 cum: see n. to 1 755.
1064flu1mine, as 1053 fluctu.

1065—1089: the fact that only iron is attracted by the loadstone
need not excite wonder: many things can be joined together only by
801116 0116 substance, stones woods various metals : then some liquids will
mix, others will not : in all cases of mixture and adhesion the cavities
of one substance must mutually come in contact with and fitthe solid
parts of the other: sometimes too the union is like that of hooks and

eyes, as indeed seems to be the case with this stone and iron. 1065
llaec, such cases of attraction3 alluding not to the exceptional case
which immediately precedes but to 998-1041, 1067 sinylariter:
though no other instance is known of this contraction, it must be ge-
nuine, and does not seem harsher than 1088 coplata, which appears
only in Lucr., or than perviylamla striylibus friyclaria and the like:
Lucr. three times has aqua, a form probably peculiar to him and found
too only in this book. 1068 colescere: see n. to II 1061 coluerint.
