tive remark of Servius to Aen. 1 616 ‘ applicat: secundum praesentem
usum per d prima syllaba scribitur: secundum antiquam orthographiam
. . per p’: yet in defiance of all this Wagner makes Virgil always to
write adpareo and the like.

142—164: the sun riseS, and the world is at once clothed in light 3
yet its rays are complex, not single, and do not pass through a void ε
how much more swiftly then must first-beginnings move? since they ¹
travel through a perfect void and travel singly‚ and each is one indivisible
whole. 144 Primum cet.: Aen. IX 459 Et iam prima novo sparyebat
lumine terras . . aurora: so that Virgil seems, as Lach. remarkS‚ to have
understood primum of time, not of order: how Lucr. meant it, is not
easy to say. 145 var. voL: see n. to 1 589. 146 tenerum: see n.
to 1 207. liquidis voe. : IV 981 citharae liquidum carmen 3 v 137 9 liqui-
das avium voces. loca: Virg. geor. IV 515 et maestis late loca questibus
implet. 148 convestire: Cicero in his Aratea uses Ι find convestire or
vestire 5 times of light: Lucr. has prob. borrowed this, as many other
expressions, from him: Aen. VI 64O lumine vestit: par. lost 111 10 as
with a mantle didst invest. 152 aerias quasi . ,undas i. 6. the air
which offers a resistance like waves of water. 155 there is at once
an interna] and external hindrance to absolutely swift motion. inter se
retr. they pull and are pulled back, because in one ray there is an enor-
mous number of atoms combined. eaetra τ see 151. 156 Officiuntwr,
the only instance in Lucr. where a verb which governs a dat. in the
active, has a personal passive: he twice uses the part. offectus, IV 763
v 776. The licence appears to be altogether very rare: Horace has
imperor and invide0r3 Ovid trist. 111 lO 35 Vite equidem credar. 158
Cum..f0ri3 is in contrast with 151 Non per. . undas 3 159 ipsa...fe-
riantur with 153 Nec sinyill....ire t there can be no doubt therefore that
159 ipsa, suis e partibus una refers to the primordia, each one of which
is a unum suis e partibus, that is one indivisible whole of parts which are
absolute leasts and incapable of existing alone, as we have explained so
fully 1 599 foll.: with suis e partibus una comp. ΙΙΙ 545 contracta suis e
partibus [anima] : he could hardly without an awkward periphrasis have
expressed what he means without using the plur. una3 nor is it any
harsher than Oic. pro Flacco 63 unis moribus et numquam mutatis Zeqi-
bus vivunt. ipsa, una e = ipsa, quorum quicque est unum e. 160
only means that they race perpendicularly down space, so as to continue
the direction they have once taken, in unum locum, in quem coepere
[ferri]. 163 164 recur IV 207 208. 163 Muhipleoe, many times
as much, πολλαπλάσιος. 164 pervolqant = 1 4 Concelebras. Epicurus
says himself in Diog. Laer. X 46 ἤ διὰ τοῦ κενοῦ φορσῖ κατὰ μηδεμίαν
ἀπάντησιν τῶν οἶντικοψάντων γινομένη πᾶν μῆκος περιληπτὸν ἐν ἀπερινοήτῳ
χρόνῳ συντελεῖ.
