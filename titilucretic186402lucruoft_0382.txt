trum qui Zeyes iuraque servat, had probably no accurate distinction 111·
1118 mind between the last two words, as iura comprises strictly speaking

consulta, Zeyes and many other things besides. 1145 and 1150 colere
aevom: so Plautus and Terence vitam colere for vivere. 1152 quem-
que 1. 8. every one who perpetrates the vis and iniuria. 1156 there

is probably some sarcasm in the divom ,· though it may be a mere con-
ventional term of speech, and said with reference to the offender’s
thoughts. 1157 id sore clam: Plaut. trucul. 1v 3 21 Mea uuncfaci-
nora aperiuntur, clam quae speravi fore3 Ter. adel. 71 Si sperat fore
clam: see n. to 11 568 palam est. Here again we may notice, as was
observed in n. to 1020, that Lucr. softens and tones down what Epicurus
himself expresses in all its naked harshness, Diog. Laer. x 151 ἤ ἀδικία
οὗ καθ’ ἑαυτήν κακὸν, ἀλλ’ ἐν τῷ κατοῖ τήν ὑποψίαν φόβῳ εἰ μὴ λήσει τούς
ὑπὲρ τῶν τοιούτων ἐφεστηκότας κολαστάς. οὐκ ἔστι τᾶν λάθρα τι ποιοῦιτα ὧν
συνέθεντο πρὸς ἀλλήλους εἰς ’τό μὴ βλάπτειν μηδὲ βλάπτεσθαι, πιστεύειν
ὅτι λήσει, κᾶν μυριάκις ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος λανθάνῃ· μέχρι γοῖρ καταστροφῆς
ἄδηλον εἰ καὶ λήσεις Sen. epist. 97 makes much of this theme, eleqanter
itaque ab Epicuro dictum puto potest nocenti contingere ut lateat, latendi
fides non potest . . tuta scelera esse possunt, secura ‘non possunt, and more
to the same purpose: timere semper et expavescere et securitati dvffidere:
and so the epicurean in Cic. de fin. 1 50 quamvis occulte fecerit, numquam
tamen id cowfidetfore semper occultum cet. 1139 protraxe: see n. to
1 233 consumpse, and comp. 111 650 abstraxe.

1161—1193: men believed in and worshipped gods, because they
saw with their waking minds and still more in sleep shapes of preter-
human size and beauty and strength: as these shapes were ever pre-
sent and as their might appeared so great, they deemed them to be
immortal3 and to be blessed‚ because they could do such deeds and
had no sear of death: they saw too the seasons change, and all the
wonders of the heaven 3 they therefore placed their gods in heaven and
believed all things to be governed by their providence. 1163 sacra,
1164 sacra: see n. to 1v 1259 liquidis et liquida. 1169 divom cet:
something has been said already of the gods of EpicuruS, 146 foll. and
11 646 foll. and many passages quoted: Sextus adv. math. IX 25 exactly
agrees with Lucr. Ἐπίκουρος δὲ ἐκ τῶν καταῖ τούς ὕπνους φαντασιῶν οἴεται
τούς ἀνθρώπους ἔννοιαν ε’σπακέναι θεοῦ. μεγάλων ’γοῖρ εἰδώλων, φησί, καὶ
ἅνθρωπομόρφων κατοὶ τούς ὕπνους προσπιπτόντων ὑπέλαβον καὶ ταῖς ἅλη-
θείαις ὖπάρχειν τινοῖς τοιούτους θεοὺς οἷνθρωπομόρφους. 1170 animo
viyilanta 1171 iu somnis: Velleius in Cic. de nat. deor. 1 46 a natura
habemus omnes omnium qentium speciem ‘nullam aliam nisi humanam
deorum. quae enim alia forma occurrit umquam aut viqilauti cuiquam
aut dormienti? all this part of Cicero will illustrate Lucr. who means
to say that all these sensible impressions of the form size and beauty
