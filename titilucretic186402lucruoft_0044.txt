26 NOTEs 1

most ancient period of which we have any record, centuries before
Cicero or Lucretius, a compromise was made between these opposing in-
terests: words in common use soon began to change the consonant,
those in less common use retained it longer. In the new corpus inscrip-
tionum Latinarum, the most recent of which are as old as the age of
Lucretius, most of them much older, imperator occurs 26 times, and is
always spelt with m, proving that in a word, which must daily have
been in everybody's mouth, etymology in remote times yielded as was
natural to sound: imperium again occurs three, inperium six times,
being doubtless in somewhat less common use. Now in Lucretius impe-
rium impero or imperito occurs six times, and the mss. always spell it
with m, and so Lucretius spelt it I have no doubt: indeed many of
these common words the silver age I believe more frequently wrote with
u, than did that of Cicero. Then virgil uses imperium 40 times 3 and
Ribbeck’s capital mss. 116176 ‘m in every instance, except M which twice
has inp„ though one even of these two cases is doubtful: for Aen. v111
381 Fogginius prints imperiis. Yet in defiance of all this evidence
Wagner gives us inperium, surely without reason on any view of the
case3 for the foundation on which we must build is thus withdrawn
from under our feet. To take another common instance, commuto
occurs 9 times in the corpus inser. and always with m 3 12 times in
Lucretius and always with m. Other words are more uncertain: we
find in the mss. impius and inpius, immortalis and inmortalis, conliqere
and colliqere‚ compleo and conpleo; and so with other prepositions ab,
ob, sub, acl: all tending to prove that usage was in most words uncer-
tain. Again we have eoesto and exto, exsolvo, exulto expiro expecto cet.‚ 8
being generally omitted3 and this agrees with Quintilian Ι 74 who implies
that it was a learned affectation of some to write exspecto in order to
distinguish em and specto from ew and peoto; it agrees too with all other
good evidence: the mss. of Virgil furnish precisely the same testimony
as those of Lucretius, yet Wagner in all such cases writes exe: surely
we should keep ex where the mss, keep it, eoes where they have exst and
so with supter 01 subter, suptilis or subtilia ab- 01 ap-, ob· or op-, sub· or
sup, succ· or susc· and the like: we find haud and haut, and sometimes
aliut aliquit quicquit and the like, sound and etymology carrying on an
undecided battle 111 the mss. of Lucretius, as in inscriptions and else-
where: adque is sometimes but ra-rely found, sound having here as might
be expected gained the victory: Wagner cannot be right in always
forcing adque on Virgil. Lucretius seems to have recognised only sed.-
he once has elabsa, and once praescribta: see notes 2 to 171 92. 111 611611
forms sound must have at an early period 111-6176116113 and b d 9 gave
way to p t c before s and t: lapsus for labsus is the same principle 'as
rex (reos) rexi (recsi) written sometimes rec-xi, ‘rectum from reqo: to
judge from the best 11166. labsus and the like became again much more
common in the silver age.

Another question involving a multitude of details is the use of -is
or -es in the accus. plur. of participles and adjectives and substantives
whose gen. plur. ends in ium, as well as of some other classes, doloris or
dolores, maioris or maiores: here too Wagner involves himself in inex-
tricable perplexities by his eclectic system, when his mss. were admirable
