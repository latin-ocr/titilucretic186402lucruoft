may be compared: 866 6180 11. to 11 202. 633 per se i. e. sine corpore:
to sentire and esse, animae is understood from 632.

634—669 t since life and sense pervade the whole body, if it be cut
in two by a sudden stroke, the 80111 must also be divided3 but what is
divided cannot be immortal: a soldier’s arm or foot or head cut off in
the heat of battle will shew for a time remains of sense and motion:
a serpent chopped in pieces will writhe and with the severed mouth seek
to reach the other pieces of the body: now you cannot say that in each
part there is an entire 80111, therefore the soul has been divided, and
therefore is as mortal as the body. 639 dissicietur: 866 11. to 11

as these have been last mentioned and are the only parts that could well
be chopped up, this appears quite natural : the tongue is specified
because it afterwards tries to lick these pieces. 660 ancisa seems

670—678: if the 80111 18 immortal, why cannot we recollect what hap-
pened before our birth? if the mind is so changed as to forget every-
thing, that is very like death 3 so that even thus you must admit that
the soul which then was, has perished‚ and that the one which now

is, is newly made. 672 super=insuperz see n. to 1 649. anteactam ‚

was before birth has really perished‚ and on entering a new body has ,

really become a new and different soul: in the above passage he is ’

should not seem to be 80 mixed up with it, but should have a 11016

the very teeth have feeling3 it therefore has birth and dies3 else it}

could not be so united with the body, nor being 80 united, leave itit}
entire. but if it can so enter and then spread itself over the whole body,
