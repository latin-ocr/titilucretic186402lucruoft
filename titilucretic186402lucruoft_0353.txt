Book v 335

416—431 : ‘ I will now describe how the various parts of the world
were formed: as we said above, it was not by design that atoms framed
it 3 but after many fruitless collisions, they chanced to fall into such
motions as produced the world and all that is in it'. 416 ille is
emphatic, as 11 362. 419—431, except only 427, are all found 6136-
where: 419—422 Nam—modis multis =1 1021—1024: 422—426 multa

ference 11 1061—1063: we meet again here what we have met already
111 this and former books: this passage which is the preface to one of the
grandest parts of the poem is itself ill—constructed and patched up from
various sources, shewing once more that the poem was left by its author
in an unfinished state and that he had carefully worked up some por-
tions, though he had not yet properly connected them with the rest of
the poem. 422 foll. comp, the epicurean passage, taken perhaps from
Epicurus himself, in Plut. de plac. phil. Ι 4 τῶν οἶτόμων σωμάτων οἷπρο
νόητον καὶ τυχαίαν ἐχόντων τήν κίνησιν συνεχῶς τε καὶ τάχιστα κινουμένων
εἷς τό αὐτό, πολλοὶ σώματα συνηθροίσθη καὶ διοῖ τοῦτο ποικιλίαν ἔχοντα
καὶ σχημάτων καὶ μεγεθῶν. 423 playis Ponderibusque, by the joint
action of which, as so fully shewn in Π, the first-beginnings are able to
come into collision and union. 430 saepe: in 11 semper: both are
equally appropriate: saepe is 011 many other occasions and also at the
‘foundation of 0111 world, Terrai maris cet.

432—448: then could be 36611 nothing that now is seen, sun stars
earth sea heaven, but a strange chaotic jumble of atoms unable to
combine: gradually the different parts of the world began to separate.
432 foll.: comp. Emped. 72 Ἔνθ’ οὐδ’ ἠελίοιο δεδίσκεται(2) οἰγλαὸν εἶδος
Οὐδὲ μὲν οὐδ’ αἴης λάσιον δέμας οὐδὲ θάλασσα. 432 solis rota: 564
Nec ‘nimio solis maior rota nec minor ardor Esse potest shows the rota to
be the orbis: many of the poets, beginning with Enn. ann. 548 pate—
fecit radiis rota eandida. caelum, use the same phrase: see Fore: but
Vitruvius also IX 2 (4) has plena rota totius orbis, sub rotam solis radios-
que and similar expressions in a technical astronomical description: is
there not then an allusion to the wheel as astronomical symbol of the
