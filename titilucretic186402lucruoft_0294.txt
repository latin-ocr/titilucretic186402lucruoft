800 introduction p. 26. 1046 vivo atque videnti, an alliterative pro-
verb, as Lamb. has seen, strengthened by the oxymoron Mortua cui vita
est: it occurs in Plautus and Terence and Cic. pro Sestio 59 vivus, ut
aiunt, est et videns cum victu ac vestitu suo publicatus, 1048 viyilans
cet.: Plaut. Amph. 697 and capt. 848 viqilans somniat3 8ο that this
line too is proverbial: Ter. eun. 1079 stertit noetis et dies: unless I
greatly err, there are very many proofs in Lucr. that he was well ac-
quainted with this play, as might have been expected. 1051 Ebrius
may here mean, having the mind disordered and stupefied, or else reel-
ing like a drunkard under the load of trouble: the metaphor is more
obvious, when Horace speaks of one fortuna clulci Ebria, or Catullus of
a lover's ebrios ocellos.

1053—10'75: men feel a burden pressing 00 their minds3 but if
they knew why it weighs upon them, they would not live as they dc,
trying by constant change 01 place to escape from themselves: they
would give up everything else to study the nature of thingS, since they
have to 1οαΓο what their condition is to be not for an hour, but for all
eternity. 1056 mali moles : the assonance is evidently designed 3 as
Cic. in Catil. 111 17 non facile lianc tantam molem mali a cervicibus ves-
tris depulissem 3 de orat. 1 2 in eo maa-imae moles molestiarum et turbu-
lentissimae tempestates extiterunt, where there is assonance and allitera-
tion. 1058 foll. comp. Enn. trag. 256 Otioso in otio animus nescit
quid velit...Imus liue, illuc hinc; cum illuc ventum est, ire illinc lubet:
I ncerte errat animus, praeter propter vitam vivitur. 1063 mannos
were small Gallic horses famous for swiftness and evidently in great de-
mand at Rome for use in harness: Horace mentions them in his odes
epodes and epistles. praecipitanter seems not to occur elsewhere.
1068 Hoc se cet. quoted by Seu. de tranq. an. 2 14 aliud ex alio iter
suscipitur et spectacula spectaculis mutantur. ut ait Inieretius Hoc se
quisque modo semper fugit. secl quid prodest, si non effuyit 2 sequitur se
ipse et ur9et 9ravissimus eomes ε 110 rightly marks the antithesis between
fuyit and effuyit3 comp. Cic. de fin. v 20 ne vitationem quidem doloris
ipsam per se quisquam in rebus expetendis putavit, nisi etiam evitare
posset 3 and 800. epist. 93 at end quid autem acl rem pertinet quam cliu
vites quod evitare non possis‘t Hor. epist. 1 14 13 In culpa est emimus
quise non effuqit umquam. 1069 inqratis: 800 0. to 935 qratis. et
odit [se]: see n. to VI 1022 00 Lucretius' love of parentheses like this.
1070 morbi aeqer i. e. quia morbum sentit, sed quibus e causis fiat
nescit: comp. 1053 1011. 1071 rebus relictis, well illustrated by
Lamb. from Plautus and Terence, means ceteris rebus relictis. 1072
Felix qui potuit rerum coynoseere eausas3 and Epic. in Diog. Laert. x
143 οὖκ ἦν τὸ φοβούμενον λύειν ὑπὲρ τῶν κυριωτάτων μή κατειδότα τίς
ἦ τοῦ σύμπαντος φύσις κ.τ.λ.
