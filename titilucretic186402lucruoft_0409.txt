BOOK VI 391

decellere = declinare. 574 prolapsa answers to inclinatur, recipit sedes
in pondere to retro recellit: falling forward out of its place is the natural
force of prolapsa: see Fore. and comp. 1006 primordia ferri In vacuum
prolapsa cadunt coniuncta: recipit sedes in pondere then is a proper
expression, not prolapsa in pondera: a thing prolabitur trans pondera,
tumbles beyond its balance or centre of gravity: Lach. well illustrates
this sense of the plur. pondera: 11 218 Ponderibus propriis . . decellere
paulum: but when he adds ‘sed pondus singulari numero ita dici non
posse Turnebus [advers. IV 17] recte observavit’, he and Turnebus are
both greatly mistaken: Ovid met. 1 12 writes Nec circumfuso pendebat
in aere tellus Ponderibus librata suis, and Lucan Ι 57 Sentiet amis onus,·
librati pondera caeli Orbe tene medio 3 but then with precisely the same
force Manil. 1 173 has Quodni librato penderet pondere tellus, Petron.
sat. 124 v. 264 Sentit terra deos mutataque sidera pondus Quaesivere
suum: Hor. epist. 1 6 51 says coyat trans pondera deaetram Porriyere3
but then with just the same meaning Petron. 136 fracta est putris sella,
quae staturae altitudinem adiecerat, anumque pondere suo deiectam super
foculum mittit: reason and authority are both for pondere. 5¹76 per-
hilum seems a ἅπαξ λεγόμ.

577—60'7: again when wind and air enter from without or rise up
from the ground into these caverns, after eddying about they sometimes
cleave the crust of earth and swallow up whole towns 3 or, if they do
not break through, yet they cause the earth to quake, and excite in
men a feeling that the world will one day perish.—Epicurus in Seneca
l. 1. seems briefly to allude to the same cause: potest terram commovere
impressio spiritus: fortasse enim aer alio intrante aere ayitatur. 5¹77
baec eiusdem quoque: quoque seems manifestly to belong to baec: haee
quoque eausa est eiusdem cet: see n. to V 192: he appears not to avoid
allowing one or more words to come between quoque and the word

to which it belongs: see also n. to IV 532. 579 ipsa tell.; see 11. to IV
736. 584 concinnat hiatum: he has also concinnat fervorem, amorem,
id. 585 In Syria Sidone probably alludes to the earthquake which

Strabo p. 58 recounts on the authority of Posidonius, καταποθῆναι πόλιν
ἱδρυμένην ὑπὲρ Σιδῶνος, καὶ αὐτῆς δὲ Σιδῶνος σχέδον τοὶ δύο μέρη πεσεῖν
...τό δ’ αὐτὸ πάθος καὶ ἐπὶ τήν Συρίαν ὅλην διέτεινε. Aegi: he alludes
to the famous earthquake of Β.Ο. 372 which swallowed up Helice and
Bura and ten Lacedaemonian triremes moored off the coast: Ovid met.
xv 293 Si quaeras Helicen et Burin, Achaidas urbes, Invenies sub aquis:
it is mentioned by many Greek and Latin writers, by Seneca l. l. more
than once, as 23 4 Callisthenes in libris quibus describit quemadmodum
Helice Burisque mersae sunt, quis illas casus in mare vel in illas mare
immersit, dicit id quod in priore parte dictum est, ‘ spiritus intrat terram
per occulta foramina cet.': Lucr. mentions Aegium no doubt because it
