forms the part of a multitude: this sense is therefore more poetical than
and also implies that of peopling. 5 lumina solis: in the nom. and
acc. the plur. is much ostener used than the sing. by Lucr. to express
the φάος ἠελίοιο. 6 te...Adventumque tuum: comp. 12 te...tuumque
initum : this form of expression is singularly stately. '7 daedala well
explained in Paulus exc. ex Festo p. 68 (52): daedalam a varietate
rerum artificiorumque dictam esse apud Lucretium terram, apud Ennium
Minervam, apud Virqilium Circen, facile est intelliyere‚ cum Graece δαιδάλ-
λειν siqnificet variare. Lucr. applies it also to nature and to the tongue,
followed by a gen. 3 and in a pass. sense to poems and to statues.
8 summittit a favourite word of Lucr. in this signification. rident here, as
11 559 ridet placidi pellacia ponti and v 1005 ridentibus undis, has
simply the sense of nitet diffuso lumine in 9, and rident in 111 22: there
seems to be no allusion to that plashing ringing ripple so often seen on
Greek and Italian seas in spring which Aeschylus expresses by γέλασμα,
and Aristot. probl. xxm 1 and 24 by ἐπιγελᾶνε that is rather the ca-
chinni and cachinnat of Catullus and Attius. 9 Placatumque: VI 48
Ventorum ex ira ut placentur 3 so Virg. tumida aequora placat and pla-
cataque venti Dant maria, the opposite of Horace's iratum mare.

10 Nam etc. a poet’s logic: he assumes the sunshine and the spring
to follow on the advent of Venus, because when they do come, all
living things turn to thoughts of love: It ver et Venus et veris prae-
nuntius ante Pennatus yraditur zephyrus. species verna diei i. e. species
veris: comp. 119 Per qentis Italas hominum, and n. there3 and 1v 733
Cerbereasque canum facies: it means that aspect of day which belongs
to spring. 11 reserata: the sera being removed from the door of its
prison. Ovid fasti 11 453 et sex reserata (liebus Carceris Aeolii ianua

sense in which yenitalis is so often employed by him. Varro de ling. 2 ἵ

Lat. v 17 Aetheris et terrae yenitabile quaerere tempus, which is rightly
given to Lucilius though the mss. assign it to Lucr.: the word is also

used actively by Avienus and Arnobius. VI 805 mactabilis is qui 3
mactat: so Virg. penetrabile telum and friyus ; Ovid penetrabile telum
and flhlmen=quod penetrat, in which sense Lucr. more than once has [ss3
