tendere se atque parare. 1124 iter viai: see n. to 11 626. infestmn
fiee: see n.' to 983. 1127 vaporant seems to be used here in a pecu-
liar sense, analogous to that in which he always uses the subst. vapor.
1130 ‘reyere imp: Aen. Vl 851 Tu ‘reyere imperio populos, Romane, me-
mento. 1131 sanquine sudent: this fine expression is used literally
vl 1147 Sudabant etiam fauces. . Sanquine: Eun. trag. 213 terra sudat
sanquine 3 Livy XXVII 4 14 quattuor siyna sanquine multo diem ac noc-
tem sudasse3 and such a notion as this may have given occasion to
Lucretius' use of the word. 1133 sapiunt al. ex ore: cannot therefore
know the true nature of things, and must always animi incerto errore
vaqari. 1135 N ec magas cet.: he recalls himself from his digression
into the matters of his day to the subject in hand, the early state of the
world.

1136—1160: thus kings were overthrown‚ and the rabble scrambled
for supreme power 3 till nations wea-ry ‘of violence established laws and
constitutions: then fear of punishment restrained men, as injustice
generally recoils on the wrongdoer, and if he escape punishment, he
cannot escape the terrours of conscience. 1136 Eryo req. occ.: because
they had attained supreme power, and therefore attracted the lightning
of envy and been dashed to the earth. 1140 metatum: I find no
other instance of this partic. though metuendus is so common ; but so it
is with timeo horreo and some other verbs of fearing. 1141 Res redi-
bat: there seems to be a play on the double meaning of res, between ‘res
redit, ‘matters are brought to such a pitch,’ and res in the sense of ‘res
publica 3 for redeo can thus be used in the sense of res redit: pilis missis
ad yladz'os redierunt, says Caesar: res ad ‘triarios redit, says Livy, and
so fortunae meae eo ‘redeunt and the like. 1142 summatum: I find
no other instance of this word. 1143 partim i. e. ex iis hominibus
pafrtim or aliqui docuere: a use common in the best writers3 1083 Ec
pafrtim mucant3 1310 partim prae se misere leones3 111 78 Intereunt
pafrtim. · 1144 I ura, Zeqibus, 1147 ἶ6963 artaque iura: in the former case
these words are probably synonymes 3 in the latter tautological 3 though
of course ius has a wider meaning than lex and includes all which is or
ought to be legally right: Horace too when he wrote Qui consulta pa-
