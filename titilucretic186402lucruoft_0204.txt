1083—1113 : again they teach that while earth and water tend to
the centre, air and fire fly from it, and that the earth sends up food to
the trec-tops: they thus contradict themselves: the truth is that the
whole of this doctrine is alike false3 for, space being infinite, if mat-
ter were finite, the world and all that is in it, would in a moment
dissolve into their first· beginnings: if on any one side matter fails,
the door of destruction is opened to all alike.—Zeno l.1. thus teaches‚

agrees with what Lucr. affirms. 1085 131113 v. seems clearly to inter-

both violate the laws of elision: see Luc. Mueller de re metr. p. 284.

1094-1101 see notes l: it is clear that in the lost vss. the clause
‘nisi cet. had to be completed3 then an apodosis to quoniam cet. must
have come, shewing that these people were not only wrong, but in-
consistent: then a new sentence must have followed, declaring that
space being infinite, as even the stoics admitted, matter as proved
above must be infinite likewise, Ne cet. 1102 volucri a natural
