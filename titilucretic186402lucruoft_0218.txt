be looked upon as an individual thing3 so here this motion of declina-
tion is so small, as not to admit of having the distinctive term ‘ slant-
ing' applied to it: he thus hopes to escape the necessity of asserting
that atoms can of themselves move obliquely. 248 quod=quoad or
quantum: see Lach. to v 1033: so quod commodo tuo fiat, quod potero,
quod potes, quod sine iactura reipublicae fieri posset in Cicero Terence
Livy respectively. 249 recta reyione seems unquestionably right 3 I
cannot understand Lachmann's objections: comp. Livy XXI 31 9 non
recta reqione iter instituit, sed ad laevam.. flexic3 Cic. Verr. V 176 si
qui tantulum de recta reqione deflexerit 3 and 181 haec eadem est nostrae
rationis reqio et via: in the sent. Minue. corp. inser. Lat. 1 199 recta re-
9ione, in a direct line, twice occurs, 250 sese is harsh thus separated
from decliname3 but I now think it is what Lucr. wrote3 as he has
many such collocations of words, sometimes in order to produce a pecu-
liar effect, sometimes from pure indifference: see the instances in n. to

is very similar to our passage.

251—293: again if there is no such declination of atoms to break
the etei-nal sameness of their motions, the perpetual sequence of cause
and effect, whence have all living things freewill‘l whence can we
change our motions at pleasure‘l thus horses cannot start in a race at
once: motion has to spread from the heart through the limbs: thus too
when we are carried along by an externa] force, there is something in us
which resists, and enables us sometimes to stop: while the weight then
of atoms enables them sometimes to withstand the external force of
blows, it is only this declination of atoms at quite uncertain times and
places which gives the mind its freedom of action. 251 foll. Cic. de
sato 23 states this as the chief motive with Epicurus for devising this
tercius quidam motus extra pondus et playam: lianc Epicurus rationem
indua-u ob eam rem, quod veritus est ne, si semper atomus yram'tatejerretur

’ naturali ac necessaria, nihil liberum nobis esset, cum ita moveretur atomus

ut atomorum motu coyeretur. 252 ordine certo, i. e. if they move
straight down by inherent gravity and only change their motion by
playae, or collision with other atoms. ’ 258 proyredimur we men for-

instance among other living beings. Epicurus always passionately main-
tained the doctrine of freewill in opposition to the everlasting necessity
