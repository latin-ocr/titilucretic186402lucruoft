true insight into their character. As he had no knowledge of the lan-
guage or philosophy of his author, 116 undertook to explain whatever
words he put into his text in long turgid notes of unmeaning verbiage.
His work was got through with a strange precipitancy: when engaged
on the first part, he had never read the other parts of the poem; when
he came to them, he had forgotten what went before. Morbidly vain
and utterly unconscious of the immeasurable distance between Lambi-
nus and himself, he assails the most brilliant and certain emendations of
the unrivalled scholar in a hideous jargon and in terms of abuse that
would be too strong even for his own errors. Thus by some fatality or
other, by its falling into the hands of a Gifanius Havercamp Wakefield
instead of those of a Salmasius Gronovius Heinsius Bentley, the criti-
cism of Lucretius remained for centuries where it had been left by
Lambinus, nay even retrograded. And yet Wakefield did display occa-
sional flashes of native genius, and our notes will shew that not a few
certain corrections are due to him ; but from the first to the last of his
1200 huge quarto pages there is not a single explanation of the
words or philosophy of his author for which a schoolboy would thank
him: so incurably inaccurate and illogical was his mind. Yet owing to
the boldness with which 116 asserted his pretensions 116 was thought even
by scholars to have done something great for his author: 116 received

, complimentary letters from Heyne and Jacobs, ‘ hominibus modestis et

ab omni iudicii subtilitate abhorrentibus' 3 and more than thirty years
afterwards Forbiger in preparing his compilation for the use of the
general public took him for his supreme authority. Even later than
that so great* a scholar as Ph. Wagner often appeals to him in his notes
to Virgil. But though long in coming the avenger was to be.

Already in 1832 Madvig in a short academical program, afterwards
republished among his opuscula, exposed the futility of Wakefield’s cri-
ticism and gave some intimations of the right course to pursue. Stimu-
lated by his example more than one scholar followed up the attack. The
most important contribution of this kind was made by Jacob Bernays in
an article printed in the Rhenish museum of 1847. This able paper
would have produced a greater effect than it did, if it had not been so
soon superseded by Lachmann's more complete and systematical work.
This illustrious scholar great in so many departments of philology, sacred
classical and Teutonic, seems to have looked upon Latin poetry as his
peculiar province. Lucretius his greatest work was the main occupation
of the last five years of his life, from the autumn of 1845 to November
1850. Fortunately he had the full use for many months of the two
Leyden mss. His native sagacity, guided and sharpened by long and
varied experience, saw at a glance their relations to each other and to
the original from whence they were derived, and made clear the arbitrary
way in which the common texts had been constructed. His zeal warm-
ing as he advanced, one truth after another revealed itself to him, so that
at length he obtained by successive steps a clear insight into the condi-
tion in which the poem left the hands of its author in the most essential
points. Like many other great scholars he seems to have kept few or
no common-place books. Resolved to master his subject 116 perused the-
grammarians and poets and nearly the whole of the older writers in
