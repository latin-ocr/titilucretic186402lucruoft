and 11 18 ruit in dicendo. '741 after Homer’s κεῖτο μέγας μεγαλωστί,
which Virgil and Ovid imitate in various ways, yravis qraviterque ad
terrafm concidit, inyentem atque inqenti vulnere victum, maynum maqno
conamine and the like: Lucr. himself 1v 902 ‘maynum mayno molimine
navem. ibi is here very emphatic, and therefore its unusual position
gives it additional force.

'742 motus cet. the impossibility of which without void he has proved
at such length above 335—397: Empedocles 63 thus denies void, Οὖδέ
τι τοῦ παντὸς κενεὸν πέλει οὐδὲ περισσόνῑ comp. 1300 Arist. de gen. et corr.
1 8 where he elaborately criticises Empedocles’ doctrine of πόροι and of
the motions and unions of things by means of these without void, and
shews that his πόροι 11111813 really mean much the same as the κενόν of
Leucippus, though Empedocles maintains a πλῆρεςε 116 concludes that
this system of πόροι is ἦ ψεῦδος ἢ μάταιον. '745 admiscent in corpus:
Pliny nat. hist. XXVI 104 has same constr. '74¹7 pausam, 6 word
occurring six times in Lucr. 3 found also in Plautus Ennius Attius, and
again brought into use by Gellius Appuleius and other imitators of the
older writers. frayori: Lucr. alone appears to use this word in its
literal sense, here and v 109, 317 3 and perhaps in the two last places
the meaning is transitional. '748 nec prorsum = et prorsum non, om-
nino non: comp. 1005 Nec prorsum facere ; 111 45 Nec prosum quicquam
nostrae rationis eqere ς 1087 Nec prorsum.. demimus hilum Tempore de
morti83 Cic. de fin. 11 17 non prorsus, inquit3 de nat. deor. 111 21 nullo
modo prorsus adsentior. Cio. acad. post. 27 speaking of peripatetics and
academics will illustrate Lucr. eaque etiam interire, non in nihilum, sed
in suas partes quae infinite secari ac dividi possint, cum eit nihil omnino
in rerum natura minimum quod dividi nequeat: here is asserted of them
exactly what Luer. obj ects 130, the cum sit nihil om. in rer. nat. minimum
seeming a prose translation of 748 3 yet at the same time is denied the
inference that they pass away in nihilum, which Lucr. below 7 56 main-
tains must follow. Empedocles himself 77 and 81 strenuously denies
the same, φύσις οὐδενός ἐστιν ἁπάντων Θνητῶν οὐδέ τις οὐλομένου θανάτοιο
τελευτή κ.τ.λ. and ἔκ τε μή ὄντος οἷμήχανόν ἐστι γενέσθαι Τό τ’ ε’ὂν ἐξόλ-
λυσθαι οἷνήνυστον καὶ ἄπρηκτονε Lucr. therefore here as elsewhere is
refuting them from his own point of view. ¹749: see the full expla-
nation of this passage in 11. to 599. '750 ad sensus nostros: so far as
sense can perceive3 from which the mentis ratio may infer the same
relation between the atom and its cacumen, which holds between any
sensible thing and its cacumen. '751 quae cernere non quis are of
course the atoms3 as 600 Corporis ill. q. n. cernere sensus Iam nequeunt.
¹754 quae nos nativa vid. Esse et mortali cum c.: yes but Empedocles
saw them to be as immortal as the atoms of Epicurus: comp. 178 Αἶψα.
