he passed above it.—In this aud the following paragraphs he leaves
you your choice between the hypothesis that the sun dies daily and a
new one takes its place in the morning, and theories more resembling
the ordinary belief of astronomers 3 experience being unable to decide:

656-679 ε daylight returns at stated hours, either because the same
unchanged sun passes under the earth and comes above it again, or
because the fires of a new sun collect every morning at the proper time:
this may well be 3 for many things, such as puberty in man, come at a
certain time 3 and many things such as snow rain lightning return
pretty regularly: so it has been from the beginning and so it continues
to be.——The alternative here allowed is the same as that given in the
preceding passage: see Epicurus there cited: the old sun returns, or a
fresh one is born every day. 659 Autieipat appears clearly to govern
