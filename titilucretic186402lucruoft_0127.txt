INTRODUCTION 1 09

Why Cicero should deny him art, may be explained in more ways than
one: he had a genuine love of Ennius and is indignant that the ‘can-
tores Euphorionis ’ should presume to despise him: he aud Lucretius
agreed on taking him for their great poetica] model. At the same time
his own Aratea must have been written thirty years or more before this
letter, and he may well have been so far converted by the almost unani-
mous tendency of the poets of the day towards that style of diction
and verse which was gradually leading up to the works of Virgil and
Horace, as to deny Ennius and Lucretius much art. What remains
of their poetry, proves that both Augustus and Maecenas had formed
their style rather in the school of Catullus and Calvus than of Virgil
and Horace3 yet doubtless they would have rated the art of the latter
more highly than that of the former. Or Quintus may have dwelt
on Lucretius’ philosophical qualities 3 and Cicero who is continua-Hy
jeering at Epicurus for his want of art and scientific discipline, may
possibly include Lucretius in the same condemnation. However that
may be, if Cicero did deny him inqenium, then did the great Roman
orator display less taste than the orator and philosopher of Arles Favo-
rinus two centuries later when, as Gellius 1 21 records, he spoke of Lu-
cretius as poetae inqenio et facundia praecellentis.

Catullus, though the poem was published so short a time before his
death, must have known it, as 116 has imitated it in more than one place.
When it was given to the world, Virgil was fifteen years of age. At
such an age therefore the style and manner of Lucretius were able to
impress themselves fully on the younger poet’s susceptible mind ,· and
perhaps the highest eulogy which has ever been passed on the former is
that constant imitation of his language and thought which pervades
Virgil’s works from one end to the other. Horace too and Ovid had
carefully studied him: this commentary will in some degree shew what
they as well as Manilius owe to him, though this last disciple is not
worth much. Lucretius thus exercised indirectly no slight influence 011
the whole future career of Latin poetry. To pass to modern times, the
Italian scholars of the fifteenth century, full of enthusiasm for every-
thing classical‚ yet admired no Latin poet more than Lucretius, Virgil
alone excepted. The illustrious French scholars of the sixteenth cen-
tury, Lambinus Turnebus Scaliger, pronounced him one of the greatest,
if not the greatest of Roman poets. In more recent times 116 has been
less praised and read. The critics of Germany have in general shewn
little sympathy for him: full of their heraclitean fire they will not
tolerate anything epicurean. Goethe alone is a brilliant exception: his
sympathy and admiration for Lucretius never failed. In this country
the most recent account of the philosophy and poetry of Lucretius is at
the same time the fullest and most favourable and by far the best:
