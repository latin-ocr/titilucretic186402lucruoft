BooK 1v 61

1101. comp. 602. 152 potis est Lach. for possunt. autem. ante Ven.
and hence Avanc. J unt and all eds. before Lach. 159 9enuntur Lamb.
for yeruntur: here too a necessary correction. 167 Res ibi A and most
mss. and eds. Res sibi B Gamb. Ven. which Lach. thinks‘ unice verum.’
Res tibi Gis.

178 teratur J unt. most properly for feratur. 179 tendunt Lamb.
for tendit. Lach. puts this verse after 175, reading tendat and momine
for numine with J unt, a change which I am not now inclined to ac-
quiesce in: see 11 632. 190 fulyere AB Nic. N icc. Flor. 31 Oamb. 3
Vat. fulyure 2 Vat. Brix. Ven. eds. before Lach. 198 201: in my small
ed. I allowed by accident Lachmann's punctuation to stand. Of course
there should be a comma after si and after sese, the apodosis beginning
at Quid quae. 203 in small ed. I placed with Bern. after 188. caelum.
circum Lach. 205 (195) Lach. first transferred to its right place. 206
Quone. Nonne B corr. vulg. 211 diu AB Nic. Nice: the genuine form.
divo vulg. before Lach. 213 mundi. mundo Lach. but here, as 1 1060
and 1v 418, he seems not to feel that Lucr. calls the reflected image 0
mundus: a quite natural notion. 216 mira. mitti Lach.; but Lucr. is
here speaking not simply of the emission of images, but of their enormous
velocity. I therefore keep mira, and suppose with Purmann Jahn’s
Jahrb. vol. 67 p. 676 and Goebel obs. Lucret. p. 25 that a verse is lost.
218 fluunt Lamb. rightly, as VI 924, for fluant. This and the ten fol-
lowing verses, which are repeated in the sixth book, were undoubtedly
read in the fourth by Gellius and Nonius. There is no question there-
fore that Lucr. or his editor placed them here 3 there is just as little
question that they are much more appropriate in VI than here. 229 13
ejected by Lach. here and in the sixth book. It must I think be 10-
tained 111 both places3 for to say that we always perceive all things 1s a
simple absurdity. we always have sensation, and may at any time, if we
please, exert the sense of sight smell hearing: again Perpetuo.. .et omnia
semper would be an 1111010101)Ιο tautology.

240 didita Ald. 1 J unt. for dedita. 245 curat. coyit Lach. because,
with curat, internoscere would stand he says for an accusative, and in
that case Lucr. would make it govern another accusative, though he
allows that Ennius does not observe such a law, as in audere repressit:
a somewhat far· fetched distinction· see notes 2. 246 protrudit Lamb.
for protudit· so 280. procudit Flor. 31 Oamb. etc. Flor. 29 reads with
Nic. N 1cc protulit: Politian 111 marg. has prdtudioe in 187 110 wrote rt
over the c of cuduntur. 250 and 251, 260 and 261: Ald. 1 Junt. first
have these verses in their right order. 260 (261) privam Gis. for pmmam,
‘ex v. c.’ he says.

270 semota Ald. 1 J unt for remota: so 288. remmota B, which
may be right. 271 and 278 quae vere transpiciuntur. Lach. possessed
by his theory of quod yenus (see 11 194) without any authority reads
sunt, bene for vere, and ruins the argument in my opinion: see notes 2.
275 tum cernitur. cum Nic. Nicc. Flor. 31 Camb. etc. which has caused
much confusion in the eds. before Lach. 277 perteryet Lamb. first for
perteqet: (so perteyet AB in 249 3 but there perteryet Nic. Nicc.) pertinyet
Nic. Nico. and so all before Lamb. 283 ubi speculum J unt. for ubi in
speculum. 284 in idem Ed. for in eum.- id was absorbed by in, and em
