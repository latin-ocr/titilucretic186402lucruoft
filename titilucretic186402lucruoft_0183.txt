Book 1 165

705—'733 : for these reasons all err alike who affirm that any one of
the four so-called elements, fire air water earth, is the first-beginning of
things 3 or any two of these 3 or all four, as Empedocles teaches‚ that
famous poet and philosopher of the famous island of Sicily. ¹705
Quapropter connects what follows with what just precedes precisely as
in 635 z the things formed out of such elements as fire air etc. are as much
elements as they are. '70¹7 principium: see notes 1 to 834. ¹710 re-
rum naturas=simply res3 as natura animi=animus and the like. vertier:
Lucr. has nearly forty of these infinitives‚ many of them more than once.
¹715 anima is used for the element of air also V 236 Aurarumque leves
animae 3 Enn. Epich. 3 Aqua terra anima sol, and Virg. ecl. VI 32:
Lucr. has also V 1230 ventorum animas, VI 578 and 693 animai turbida
vis, a sense not uncommon in the poets: Attius 11 vela ventorum animae
immittere3 Aen. v111 403 Quantum iynes animaeque valent3 Hor. od.
IV 12 2 animae Thraciae. imbri for water recurs more than once in
Lucr. 3 784, 785, VI 149: both Ennius and Virgil use it for sea-water:
Empedocles too 128, 216, 286 has ὄμβρος for water generally. Arist.

Thales downwards 3 much longer lists are given by Sextus pyrrh. hypot.

curring almost verbatim in the newly discovered work of Hippol. ref.
om. haer. X 6 foll. Aristotle asserts that no one ever made earth his
element of things 3 but Sextus begins the first two of the passages just

cited by attributing this doctrine to Pherecydes of Syros. '716 quo-

because it is the shape of its coasts that renders its lands triangular:
Foro. cites Horace Quintilian Silius for this word applied to Sicily.

from the relat. to the demonstr. pron. is not unusual in Latin, though
more common in Greek: Cic. orator 9 quam intuens in eaque defixus,
and Brutus 258 omnes tum fere qui nec extra urbem hanc vixerant nee
eos aliqua barbaria domestica infuscaverat: in many cases, perhaps in
these passages of CicerO, the relat. could not be repeated: comp. Madv.
to Cio. de fin. 1 42 quod ipsum nullam ad aliam rem, ad id autem res
reseruntur omnes: Madvig opusc. 11 p. 177, and Conington to Virg.
geor. 11 208 and Aen. VI 101 give other examples of clauses appended
to relative ones in divers ways: comp. 154 Quorum operum...ac fieri
