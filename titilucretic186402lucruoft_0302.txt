193 parvola i. e. simulacra, has force by being thus placed at the
beginning instead of after quae: they are exceedingly small and there-
fore the propulsion is easier: the ambiguity in parvola causa was quite
indifferent to Lucr.: see n. to 1 57 perempta and to v 1414 ‘res illa

Tantulus ille queat tantum sol mittere lumen, Quod maria ae terras

force. 206 Quone Ι doubt not is what Lucr. wrote, but the constr. is
involved, confused even, two clauses being run into one: what 116 meant
is this I think, quo, i. e. quanto, citius et lonqius (videsne ?) debent ire!

a curiously inappropriate illustration from Quintil. 1 10 3 aut quo melius
