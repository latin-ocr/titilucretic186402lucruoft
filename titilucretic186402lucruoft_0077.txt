says ‘non aliter dari potest quam quomodo fayaan dari Vergilius dixit,
id est concedi.' But Virgil also says XII 367 fuyam dant nubila, that is
fuqiunt: see too notes 1 for many more illustrations. discessum dederit

34, except 44 Sed quoniam for Et quoniam, 47 Quoque, possit for Quove,
possint, are rightly ejected by Lach. as a gloss. In this place they are
of course quite inadmissible. J unt. vulg. put them before 26 3 and
thither, 11 retained, they must be transferred. To this Lach. offers the
objection that while the first 24 lines are repeated word for word from
the first book, in 25 we have ac persentis utilitatem for qua constet comp-
ta fiywa: this change he says was probably made because in 27 are the
words compta viqeret; but had the poet really inserted 44-4'7 before 26,
this alteration would not have been called for: see however what is said
in notes 2. 48 49 (49 50) = 29 30 and seem to be repeated here without
meaning because of the resemblance between what precedes and follows
them there and what precedes and follows here. J unt. first omitted them.
