EXPLAINING AND ILLUSTRATING THE POEM

J EROME in his additions to the Eusebian chronicle has these words
Titus Lucretius poeta nascitur qui postea amatorio poculo in furorem
versus, cum aliquot libros per intervalla insaniae conscribsisset, quos
postea Cicero emendavit, propria se manu interficit anno aetatis XLIV.
„ Donatus in his life of Virgil writes thus according to Reifferscheid
Suetonii reliq. p. 55, initia aetatis Cremonae eyit [Veryilius] usque ad
virilem toqam, quam XV anno natali suo accepit isdem illis consulibus
iterum duobus quibus erat natu-3, evenitque ut eo >ipso die Isacretius poeta
decederet. If this be true, Lucretius died about the ides of October
U. G. 699 in 'the second consulship of Pompey and Crassus. His birth
then would fall to the year 655. But the passage of J erome is assigned
to ol. 171 2 by Scaliger and most of the older authorities as well as by
Mommsen Abh. d. saechs. Ges. II p. 677 and Reifferscheid l. l. p. 38.
Mai alone in his edition of the chronicle, script. vet. coll. VIII p. 365,
gives it to the year 655: on what authority? mere conjecture, I fear, in
order to adapt it to the account of Donatus, though in his preface he says
that this part of the chronicle has been entirely changed by the help of
many Vatican mss. However that may be, whether Jerome or his
copyists are in fault, 655 must I think be right 3 for no one who has
read what so many scholars have written on the question, J oseph
Scaliger, Ritschl parergon p. 609—638, Mommsen 1. l. p. 669—-693,
Reifferscheid 1. l. p. 363-425, and otherS, will doubt that J erome's
additions are servilely copied from the lost portion of Suetonius de viris
illustribus, nor feel much less confidence that Donatus’ account comes
also from the same source. These are the sole circumstances recorded of
his life; nor is anything whatever known about his family: indeed the
onlv other instance I have been able to find of the cognomen Carus
