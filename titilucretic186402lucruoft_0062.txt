44 Ν OTES 1

mini’ divae Lach. at the suggestion of an ‘ amicus quidam' of Haverc. for
metu...numine divae. 626 iter omne viarum Turnebus Grif. Lamb. ed 2
and 3, vulg. for ite omnia virum: a certain correction. ite omnia mirum
Nic. N icc. some Vatic. and old eds. iter, omni-a circum Flor. 31 Oamb.
some Vatic. J unt. Lamb. ed. 1. 630 quod armis a certain correction of
Lach.: the sentence requiring the conjunction quod or quia, the sense
armis. catervas of mss. is a mere blunder of the scribe who has taken it
from 628: a form of error common in our mss. comp. 422 1 555 VI 15
etc. catenas of B is again a mere miswriting of cateruas, though it has
deceived many. 631 sanquinolenti Bentl. for sanquine fleti. sanquine
fieti Nic. N icc. and old eds. sanquine laeti J unt. Lamb. etc. 632 nu-
mine. momine Lach. whom I followed in my small ed.: but see Ph.
Wagner in Philologus supplement 1 p. 400 Conington to Aen. 11 123
and Lachmann’s own note : comp. also lv 179. 636 Armat et in numerum
pernice chorea: first omitted by Lamb. as manifestly made up out of
635 and 637. 653 (656) Constituit Lach. for Constituet, as mavolt fol-
lows. 657 (680): this verse, which was the last of p. 73 of the archetype,
has been transferred hither by Lach. The scribe omitted it in its place
and then wrote it at the bottom of the page. parcat Lach. for parato.
parco Flor. 31 Camb. etc. 658—660 (652—654) I have transferred
hither. The itaque of 601 manifestly refers to them 3 so that if they are
to keep their place, then (what comes to much the same thing) 652—
657 must be enclosed in brackets as a subsequent marginal addition of
the poet’s: see above, p. 22.

665 retinentque parentum Flor. 31 (not Oamb.) Vat. 1136 Othob.
1954 Othob. sm. Ald. 1 Junt. for retinente parente. 1669 quamvis...
unam Lamb. for quamvis...una. quemvis...una Nic. Nice. quemvis..
unum J unt. 674 condunt Ed. for traduntur. celant Lach. cludunt Bern.
681 privis Lach. for primis: Ihave not changed another letter here 3
but have only amended the punctuation, by putting a full stop after
odore, and none after dona. For position of iyitur comp. 678 and 569
itaque, and notes 2 to 1 419. Lach. reads in privis pluraque dona, and
there ends the sentence. In consequence of 657 (680) having been
misplaced the older editors have made strange confusion here. 683 684
sucus...Fucus Lach. most properly for sucus...Sucus: ‘ nam sucus color
est.' 684 sorsum AB only once. ‘seorsum et rerum [Faber's text} et
rerum om. mss. vv. repetendum ut puto τό sorsum G. V.' ms. notes of
Is. Vossius. Haverc. and through him Lach. misrepresent him. G. V.
is of course his father Gerard, whose reading therefore is the same as
Lachmann's. 685 privis for primis ‘idem Vossius' says Lach. after
Preiger or Haverc. who has ‘ egregie et 1106 1060 privis habet Marginalis
noster.' My ms. notes of Vossius are without it. 693 isdem Lamb. for
idem: ‘quod est sane simplicissimum, sed videtur abhorrere ab usu
Lucretii' says Lach. who reads awkwardly nulli for nulla, and idem.
But here and V 349 Lucr. unquestionably used isdem, as did his con-
temporaries. 694 constant Ed. with Β Nic. Nicc. (2) Oamb. Lamb. vulg.
constent Lach. with A corn: see 337. 696 for rerum ‘f. verum G.V.'
in Isaac's ms. notes: and so Lach. yet Zenye of Flor. 31 Camb. etc. may
be right, as the scribe might well write primordia rerum mechanically
from the mere fact of these words continually coming together. 716
