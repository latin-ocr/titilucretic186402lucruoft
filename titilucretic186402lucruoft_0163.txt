like ‘natura animi, aquae etc. 367 Dedicat used by Lucr. three times
and always in this sense: comp. iudicare: it is synon. with declamat in

370-397 : some falsely maintain that motion may take place thus:
a fish for example advances, because the water it displaces goes into the
space which it leaves. But without void how can water begin to give
place, that the fish may begin to advance? Α gain two bodies in contact
start asunder: there must be void between the two at all events until
the air has filled this space: if you say the air condenses when the
bodies are together, Ι assert that air cannot so condense 3 and if it could,
it could not thus contract without void. 370 it is not easy to say
whether illud is nom. to possit or accus. after praecurrere: whichever it
be, the other is understood. praecurrere: the metaph. is obvious: to
run before a thing, and so meet it by anticipation. 381 priv. corp. a
