5 and 6 rightly transposed by Avancius. 9 ‘norme videre A Β Gott.
which Gifi, followed tacitly by Lamb. ed. 3, has most properly retained.
videre est was the common reading, which Lach. shews Lucr. could not
have written. ‘videtis Marull.’ says Gif. But J unt. has videre est,
Ald. 1 videtis, and this is mentioned as a var. lec. at end of J unt: so
also Lamb. ed. 1, but videre est ed. 2. 17 quoi Gis. cui Avanc. for qui.
18 mente. menti' Lach. without cause. 19 semotu' Lamb. in notes
Gif. Bentl. for semota. 21 cumque. quemque J unt. Lamb. etc. perhaps
rightly: or 2 cuique: but see notes 2. 2¹7 sulqet auroque. fulqenti
Lach. But comp. v 1049 sciret animoque, where Lachmann’s scirent
perverts the meaning. fulqens, renidens Macrob. Saturn. vl 2 Avanc.

tharae. citharam, Macrob. saturn. v1 2, cithara, id. vl 4. 28 aurataque.

saturn VI 4, but V1 2 tempe, which comes perhaps from the preceding
passage of Virgil. Yet the templa of the mss. of Lucr. may have
a technical meaning. 36 Iacteris. lactaris Lamb. ed. 2 and 3: but see
notes 2. 40—46: this passage I think I have arranged much better
than Lach. or Bern: 42 et ecum vi (etecuvi) Ed. for epicuri: comp. tariter
of mss. for pariter in 43. 43 Ornatasq. armis statuas pariterque Ed. for
Ornatas armis itastuas (itasiuas B Gott.) tariterque. Fervere cum videas
classem lateque videri, which is not found in our mss. but is quoted by
Nonius p. 503 from Lucretius lib. 11, is clearly in its right place after 46,
not 43, where Lach. and others have put it. I have also put a stop
after pavide in 44. For statuas corrupted into itastuas comp. Lach. to
1v 283, and itastuam for statuam in Orelli’s inscript. 1120. Because
Lucr. v 1227 has Iuduperatorem classis super aequora verrit Cum validis
pariter Zeqiom'bus atque elephantis, Lach. says ‘ apparet haec ita legenda
esse, subsidiis maqnisque elephantis constabilitas, Ornatas armis, validas,
pariterque animatas! The apparet is anything but clear to me. Bern.
reads hastatis for epicuri, par-iter for itas-tuas. See Lach. on the way
these two verses are written in A B. Nic. Nico. omits them: later mss.
Flor. 31. Camb. etc. treat them as a heading: the old eds. to Ald 1 -
and Pius inclusive have them variously corrupted. J unt. first omits
them in text with this note at end, ‘ Subsicliis maquis Epicuri consta-
bilatas. Marullus carmen hoc expungit. Nam illud, ornatas armis
statuas, stanteisque animatas, procul dubio subditicium est.' All subse-
quent eds). before Lach. omitted them, except Gif. who mixes up a
portion of them with a part of the line from N onius in this fashion,
Fervere cum videas ,· classem lateque vaqari, Orraatcvmque armis belli simu-
lacra cientem. Lamb. ed. 3 first gives the 1. from Nonius in full.
46 pectus Lamb. for tempus: a necessary change. 53 Ald. 1 J unt.
Lamb. etc. omne sit hoc rationis eqestas, without cause. 56 sic, as in
111 88 VI 36. ita Senec. epist. 110, shewing what little reliance can be
placed on such citations. Comp. 1 66.
