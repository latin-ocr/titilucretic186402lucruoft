βάλλει, αἱ δ’ ἄτομοι οὐδὲν μεταβάλλουσιν, ἐπειδήπερ δεῖ τι ὑπομένειν ἐν
ταῖς διαλύσεσι τῶν συγκρίσεων στερεὸν καὶ ἀδιάλυτον, ὃ τὰς μεταβολὰς
οὗκ εἷς τό μή ὂν ποιήσεται οὐδ’ ἐκ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος, ἀλλὰ κατὰ μεταθέσεις μὲν
πολλῶν, τινῶν δὲ καὶ προσόδους καὶ α’φόδους. ὅθεν ἀναγκαῖον rot μὴ μετατι-
θέμενα ἄφθαρτα εἶναι καὶ τὴν τοῦ μεταβάλλοντος φύσιν οὐκ ἔχοντα.

690-704 z again why do the senses, as Heraclitus says, perceive fire
truly, but nothing else 2 one might just as well deny the reality of fire
and affirm that of all other things. 690 res, rem, rerum: see n. to

331116 construction. 696 69¹7 : that Heraclitus taught that the senses
could not truly discern things, is certain: comp. Arist. metaph. 1 6 at
beg. and the authorities quoted by Bcrnays heraclitea p. 303 and the
hippocratean π. διαίτης as there emended by him, διὰ τούτων [τῶν αἰσθή-
σεων] γνῶσις ἀνθρώποισιν οἷγνωσίηε but in what sense Heraclitus affirmed
the senses could perceive fire truly, is sar from clear: one would have
thought that the ξυνὸς λόγος 310116 could discern the πῦρ ἀείζωον, and
that the material fire was as delusive as other things, Surely Lucr.
cannot simply mean that, as Heraclitus held fire to be the sole element
of things and the only real existence, therefore when sense perceived any
other thing, it did not perceive it in its reality: when it perceived fire,
it perceived real existence ς without his having any expression of Hera-
clitus to warrant such 3 conclusion. Did Heraclitus teach that the
evei-living fire represented motion self-engendered which in 3 thousand
ways, in the human body and through the whole of nature, produces
heat or fire? comp. with this some late theories of the origin of caloric
and the sun’s heat: all things else are phases of motion thwarted and
turned from its natural course 5 fire alone gives to sense some apprehen-
sion of this real 616 and movement at the bottom of all things. ,699
