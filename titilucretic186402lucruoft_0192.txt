875—896: Anaxagoras tries to extricate himself by assuming that
everything is latent in everything3 but that that only is perceived, of
which the like particles are most numerous and most prominent: 6
manifest fallacy 3 for then corn when ground, stones when rubbed, grass
when chewed, clods when pulver-ised, wood when split should shew
little bloods, grasseS, ashes and fires, respectively: the truth is that the
seeds of things have no qualities like to those of things in being. 875
latit: comp. Cic. de fin. 11 107 si tuam dicerem, latebram haberes: notice
latitandi and 877 latitare in two different senses with nothing in com-
mon. Lucr. like the old Latin writers generally, loves as we have said
assonance alliteration antithesis and the like so dearly, that often the use
of a word seems to suggest to him a repetition of it, without any point
whatever, and therefore to our taste faulty: comp. 893 docet res, Scire

amples of its use in Lucr. Cicero etc. 875—8'79 this which Lucr.
declares to be a sorry subterfuge, was in fact the very corner-stone
of Anaxagoras’ physice. His particles were infinite in number and
smallness 3 from the necessity of the case everything was mixed with
everything, except only his veiis-z his νοῦς, 866 fr. 6 (7), was mixed up
with nothing, because if mixed up with anything, then it must have been
mixed up with everything: but ἐν παντὶ παντὸς μοῖρα ἔνεστι πλὴν νόου,
and again παντάπασι δὲ οὐδὲν ἀποκρίνεται οὐδὲ διακρίνεται τό ἕτερον dvo*

greatest number of ὁμοιομερῆ στοιχεῖα, particles like to it in kind.
