prope iam siet ire et abire3 and 111 593 labefacta videtur Ire anima.
52¹7 is the most effective instance of sound answering to sense, produced
by the simplest 11163118, that I know of in the whole range of Latin
poetry. 529 post inde: he also has post deinde, V1 763 posthinc, v
1007 tum deinde: post inde is found in Enn. ann. 11. 537 in sensu:
581 in taetro adore: the simple abl. 01 cwm would in each 6386 be more
usual 3 though in seems to have much the same force as inin vita, in

morte and the like. 540 si iam libeat: 866 11. 130 1 968. 545 suis 6
partibus I take to be the parts of the 80111 itself: comp. 11 159 ipsa suis
e partibus una. 545 obbrutescat‚ a rare word: Afranius 420 has ob-

brutui: A B both spell it with 0116 b, and so do the mss. of Nonius,
and 01 Festus Pauli twice over: opportunus occurs in Lucr. five times:
111 63611 6386 either both A B or one or the other write oportunus:
Servius to Aen. 1 616 has ‘applicatt secundum praesentem usum per d
prima syllaba scribitur: secundum antiquam orthographiam quae prae-
positionum ultimam litteram in vicinam mutabat, per p: secundum vero
euphoniam per a tantum’: i. e. only one p was sounded: this was pro-
bably the case with obbo-uc. and opport. and it seems likely that they
might be written also with one b or p. In this, 38 111 so many other
points, it is clear that the artificial modern Italian pronunciation is di-
rectly contrary to that of the old Latius with whom causa and caussa,
excisus and exscissus were identical in sound: see 11. to 1044 Bestiae-xit.

548—557: the mind is as much part of the man, as the 631 eye or
any other sense: none of these can exist alone, but decay at once: so it
is with the mind, which is as closely connected with the body as these
316. 551 atque.. ve: see notes 1. 553 Sed tamem cet=sed in
tempore quamvis parvo tamen licuntur: comp. Cic. de rep. vi 21 (somn.
Scip. VI 3) quem oceanum appellatis in terris, qui tamen tanto ‘nomine
quam sit parvus vides 3 Ter. eun. 170 Tamen contemptus abste haec habui
in memoria: the 10166 01 tamen is very much the same in 1v 953, 988,
992. 555 homine...quod vas: see n. to 943 and comp. 793 01 v 137
in eodem homine atque in eodem vase manere.

558—579: again body and 80111 depend for life one on the other:
without the body the soul cannot give birth to vital motion, nor can the
body without the 80111 continue and feel: mind and 80111 produce their
sense-giving motions, because their atoms are kept in by the bodily
frame: this they cannot do 111 13116 3113 or else the air will be a body
and an animal, if the 80111 6311 move in it as it moved in the body 3
therefore when the body dies, mind and 80111 die. 558 foll. Denique
cet. clearly begins a new argument: 111 13116 last section he shewed that
the mind, the ‘mens or animus, not the anima, has a fixed seat, viz. in
the breast, and cannot live away from the body, any more than the ear
or eye 3 but there he says nothing of the body not existing without the
