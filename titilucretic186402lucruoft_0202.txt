1052—1082 : do not believe with some that all things tend to 6 cen-
tre, and therefore the world keeps together without exter-nal force, and
things and 6111111618 beneath the earth cannot tumble into the sky any
more than we 0611 fly up to it: that our day is their night, their day our
night: this is sheer folly: there is no centre in infinity, and, if there
were, things would 1101 be attracted any more 111611 repelled by it: void
everywhere alike yields to 611 body alike.-—It is the stoics doubtless
whom Lucr. here mainly attacks, though the peripatetice and some
others held a similar doctrine: they taught that there was but one finite
world surrounded by an infinite void ; and that the world was upheld in
the way which Lucr. so clearly explains here, by all things pressing to
the centre: the earth resting ῑσοκρατῶς, 111 the words of Zeno in Stob.

whole finite κόσμος 1611161118 1681 111 1116 infinite void. Had Epicurus,
while retaining his conceptions of infinite space and matter and innume·
rable worlds and systems, seen fit to adopt this stoical doctrine of things
tending to 6 0611116, and so to make his atoms rush 'from all sides of
space alike towards 6 0611116, 116 might have anticipated the doctrine of
universal gravity: see what is said to 11 251 foll. 1052 fuye with an

of their sum which is finite. 1055 ictibus ext. 01 6101118; 866 1042 and

Zeno himself in Stob. ecl. 1. l. πάντα τοὶ μέρη τοῦ κόσμου ἐπὶ τὸ μέσον τοῦ

tical: Lach. rightly compares the form of expr. in 1v 366 Aera si credis
privatum lumine posse Induqredi: comp. also 11 603 neque posse in terra
sistere terram. 1058 1059 Lach. and some older editors join these
with 1057: this may be right, but I prefer to connect them with 1056:
