eius tranquillitas insecuta est: comp. too 545 for the use of sub, Cum
tuba depresso yraviter sub murmure muyit. '786 Cum praesertim has
here precisely the force which we are taught by Madvig de fin. p. 190 it
often has in Cicero: ‘ and that too although’: he cites pro Sex. Roscio
66 videtisne...cum praesertim deorum immortalium iussis atque oraculis
id jecisse dicantur, tamen ut eos aqitentfuriae.

'791 repetunt seems=iterant: this and the preceding v. explain the
mollia membra movere, so 1311613 repetunt has no reference 130 bracchia, but
merely to the presenting again and again 130 the eyes 13116 361116 yestum

word, because there is a play there on the literal and metaphorical
sense: for other examples 366 Fore. '794 An mayis, giving what he
believes 130 be the most likely cause. '795 13 63 we said above a para-

equal to the time in which we can utter one word, and that in 1311613
31116116313 time are latently contained many rational times, or times such
as 13116 mind 6611 conceive by its reason to exist. Thus in the smallest
thing perceptible to sight or touch are contained very many things
which the reason alone can apprehend, viz. atoms or the parts of atomS.
With Lucr. comp. the τούς διαὶ λόγου θεωρητοιῖς χρόνους and the ἐν
αἰσθητῷ χρόνῳ of Epic. in Diog. Laer. x 473 and with the Cum senti-

here nor elsewhere does he explain the all-important point how the
mind is first turned to any object of thought. When the mind is once
roused and the will set in motion, then it may be said it attends solely
or mainly to the images connected with such object ε but why should one
image more than any other image first strike on the mind‘l this he does
not explain: he attributed it I presume to accident, and therefore
thought it unnecessa-ry to enlarge upon it. Comp. 885 Ι cl quocl pro-
