days of Lucr. the muses with Pan satyrs and nymphs had silenced
the fauns with their saturnian measure. esse locuntur, not a common
constr. but occurring in Virg. ecl. V 27, Aen. 1 731. 583 taei-
turria silentia is found in Ovid ars 11 505 3 and muta silentia occurs
thrice in his met: Aen. 11 255 tacitae per amica silentia lunae. 585
Tibia: Rich in his companion gives 6 drawing of a simple pipe or
flageolet from the statue of a saun, exactly resembling that now used by
the Roman piffierari, to whom it has doubtless come down in 1111111161·-
rupted succession from antiquity. 587 capitis velamina: 1 930 61111

595—614: sounds will come through places, through which you
cannot see, because their particles 0611 pass by crooked ways, while
images can only travel through straight passages: again one voice bursts
into many similar voices, as 6 spark of fire into many sparks3 so that all
the corners of a building may be filled with sound3 but even sound
is deadened and broken in coming through such obstructions. 598
Conloquium cet.: there is in this a mixture of seeing and hearing,
exactly as in Hor. sat. 11 8 77 tum in lecto quoque videres Stridere
secreta divisos aure susurros: quite as harsh or harsher is 262 fierique

authority. 602 vitrei: see n. to 111 97: probably its confusion with

615—632: taste is quite as easy to explain 3 the flavour is pressed
out from food by chewing and passes into the pores of tongue and palate:
the flavour is pleasant, if its atoms are smooth, but the contrary, if
these are rough: when the food has got below the palate, the flavour is
no longer perceived, and the food is then indifferent, if only it can be
digested. 619 co‘e'pu: neither Ritschl pref. to trinummus p. LXXVI
nor Lach. can find another certain example of this trisyll. use 3 but the
latter says of the former ‘ quod hanc formam rationem habere negat,
