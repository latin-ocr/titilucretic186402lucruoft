more probable, if we compare Tertull. de anima 14 near end, non lonqe
hoc exemplum est¹ a Stratone et Aenesidemo et Heraclito; nam et iqosi
unitatem animae tuentur quae...per sensualia variis modis emicet: the
doctrine here assailed by Lucr. is lucidly stated by Cic. Tusc. disp. 1 46

enim ullus sensus in corpore, sed, ut non physici solum docent, verwm
eliam medici qui ista aperta el patefacta viderunt, viae quasi quaedam
sunt ad oculos, ad auris, ad naris a sede animi perforatae: he adds ani-
mum et videre ei audire, non eas partis quae quasi fenestrae sint animi 3
and so Epicharmus νόος ὁρῇ καὶ νόος ἀκούει, τᾶλλα κωφσῖ καὶ τυφλοί.

haud facile est really mean ‘it is not possible ' according to that common
rhetorical device of bringing your meaning out more strongly by under-
stating it 3 and this is the sense here: to be sure if you press the
word dicere, it is possible enough to say this or anything else 3 but then
desiperes& is equally out of place 3 for the wisest man may say it, as well as
the most foolish 3 and indeed ‘it is impossible' only means ‘it is absurd.'
364 Lumina luminibus, another instance of false antithesis: see n. to 1
875. 367—369: he concludes his case here, as so often elsewhere,
with a brief argument addressed to the common sense of men, which
here, as 1 915, takes the form of a sarcasm: see the instances given to 1
984—987. 369 postibus appears to mean the door-posts together
with their fores: so it was understood by Lactant. de opif. dei 8, where
he assails this, as he terms it, ineptissimum aryumentum of Lucr.: quo-
- niam evulsae cum postibus fores plus inserunt luminis.

370-—3952 you must not believe what Democritus teaches, that
the atoms of the soul alternate one ‘by one with those of the body, and
are therefore as many in number: they are in fact not only much
smaller, but also much fewer3 only enough to awaken sense through
the body, which often therefore does not feel very small things that
come in contact with it 3 they not exciting any part of the soul. 370

thus coupled with a proper name and without an epithet is curicus 3 its
force seems much the same as that which it has in Arma virwmque
and Aen. 1v 3 Multa viri virtus. 372 privis, 378 380 389 priva,
here and elsewhere in Lucr. are exact synonymes of singula. 373
variare is of course neuter here, as often in Lucr. This is another
leading point of difference between Epicurus and Democritus, and one
we should not have known of but for this passage: Arist. de anima 1 5
at beg. merely says of Democritus that his ψυχή 18 ἐν παντὶ τῷ αἰσθανο-
μένῳ σώματι, which would be quite as true of Epicurus’, who in many
