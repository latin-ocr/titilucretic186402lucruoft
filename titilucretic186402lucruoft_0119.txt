Greek. Let not what is said be misunderstood. During the long pe2i0d
of Grecian preeminence and literar-y glory‚ from Homer to Demosthenes,
all the manifold forms of poetry and prose which were invented one after
the other, were brought to such an exquisite perfection‚ that their
beauty of form and grace of language were never afterwards rivalled by
Latius or any other people. But hardly had Demosthenes and Aris-
totle ceased to live, when that Attic which had been gradually formed
into such a noble instrument of thought in the hands of Aristophanes
Euripides Plato and the orators and had come to supersede for general
use all the other dialectS‚ became at the same time the language of the
civilised world and was stricken with a mortal decay. It seems to have
been too subtle and delicate for any but its wonderful creators. N ay
the style and rhythm even of Menander who was born in Athens years
before the date just given shew a sad falling off, if he be compared with
Aristophanes. The Alexandrine poets who imitated earlier styles3 and
even the graceful Theocritus repeat parrot-like forms which they do not
understand, because their meaning had been lost for centurieS. If what
is said of a Menander and Theocritus be thought presumptuous, there is
no question that it is true of prose writers. Epicurus who was born in
the same year as the former writes a harsh jargon that does not deservo
to be called a style 3 and others, of whose writings anything is left
entire or in fragments, historians and philosophers alike, Polybius Chry-
sippus Philodemus, are little if at all better. When Cicero deigns to
translate any of their sentenceS, see what grace and life he instils into
their clumsily expressed thoughts! how satisfying to the ear and tastc
are the periods of Livy when he is putting into Latin the heavy and
uncouth clauses of Polybius! This may explain what Cicero means,
when at one time he gives to Greek the preference over Latin, at another
to Latin over Greek: in reading Sophocles or Plato he would acknow-
ledge their unrivalled excellence: in translating Panaetius or Philode-
mus he would feel his own immeasurable superiority.

In three places Lucretius complains of the poverty of his native
tongue: 1 136 he says in general terms that he is aware how difficult it
is to express in Latin verses the abstruse discoveries of the Greeks. But
could a Greek poet express them in Greek verses? could a Homer or
even an Euripides expound the theories of Aristotle or Chrysippus or
Epicurus more clearly than Lucretius? Surely not: in the second book
he has translated some anapaests of Euripides that consummate master
of maturcd Attio, and there is no thought in them which he cannot
express literally. Certame in difficult questions Empedocles is more
helpless than Lucretius, though he had an epic diction to imitate which
had existed for centuries. The second passage is 1 830 foll. where he
observes that the poverty of his native speech does not permit him to
