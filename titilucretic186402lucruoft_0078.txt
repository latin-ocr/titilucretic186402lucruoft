lost. N. HeinS. in ms. notes says ‘ aliquid deest :’ Haverc. suspected the
same. Lach. by an elaborate and acute calculation shews or endeavours
to shew that one page of the archetype containing 25 lines and one head-
ing, E'sse item maiora, has been lost. That a page of the archetype ended
with 126 is‘ certain 3 that another page commenced with 12¹7, and that
this page was a left-hand or even-numbered page is no less certain, as
Lach. has demonstrated. It is also perhaps more probable that 25 111168
were here lost, than double that number or more, because the poet in 115
says, as Lach. points out, percipe paucis. But Lachmann’s calculation,
taken in conjunction with his general theory of the mode in which A B
and the other mss. descended from the archetype, involves a great diffi-
culty which is discussed above p. 21. Lach. thus continues the sentence

revolves, Among the lost verses Lach. places this fragment, qui fulmine

longs to Ennius, not to Lucr. at all, as it has nothing of his style about
it ‚- and Servius Aen. 1 30 assigns it distinctly to the former, while the
words of Probus to Ecl. VI 31 are ambiguous.

left-hand numbering, were first brought into order by the acuteness of

made. Lamb. indeed sees the difficulty involved in vestem, Lach. does
