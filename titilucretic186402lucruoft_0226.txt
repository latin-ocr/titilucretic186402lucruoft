to shew the vast importance of touch 3 for not only can nothing tanqere
et tanqi sine corpore, but conversely nothing can sine tactu sentire: ‘all
the senses are but different forms of touch 3 touch therefore is the body's
sense, that is the sole and only sense, whenever the body has any feeling
whatsoever: he then enumerates the different ways in which the body
can feel: either something enters from without, and gives pleasure or
pain 3 or something takes place in the body, and gives pleasure or
pain 3 or thirdly the atoms in the body itself, before quiescent, are
troubled by some collision and so disturb the body’s feeling, as for
instance when you strike any part of the body. 438 turbant neut:

444-477 : again things hard and dense, stones metals and the like,
have hooked and branching particles 3 fluids have them smooth and
round: things again which do not cohere, but yet are pungent, smoke
mist fiame, have sharp, but not tangled elements: sea-water has particles
round and smooth mixed with others round but rough which give it its
saltness 3 and these latter by filtering you may separate from the former.
445 foll. hamatis cet: Cic. acad. pr. 11 121 ille qui asperis et levibus et
hamatis uncinatisque corporibus concreta haec esse dicat: the uncinatis =
427 flexis mucronibus unca. N ewton optics p. 251 Horsl. ‘the parts of
all homogeneal hard bodies which fully touch one another, stick together
very strongly. And for explaining how this may be some have invented
hooked atoms, which is begging the question '. 447 adamantina:
this I presume is a general epithet of great hardness. 448 ictus con-

silices: see n. to 1 571 : these blocks paving their streets and roads would
always be present to the eyes and minds of Romans. robora: see
n. to 1 882. 450 Aera, claustris, restantia are all vague words3 so
that their joint meaning must be somewhat doubtful: Aera I take to be
the bronze bars or bolts of a gate 3 claustra the staples or metal boxes into
which the bolts went to fasten the gate: apparently the strict meaning
of the word: restantia then = resistentia, as 1 110 : rest. cl. meaning
struggling with, refusing to part from 3 though claustris might be the
modal abl.: most of the editors seem to take aera for the cardo 3 but as
the ancient cardo had nothing in common with the modern hinge, claus-
tris must then apparently mean the socket of the door—flap which moved
about the aera or pivot of the postis ε this it can scarcely do· 452 fluvido z
