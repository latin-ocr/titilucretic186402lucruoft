was then changed to ewm: in was lost after id in 1v‚103·7. iterum Lach.
290 Illic quor reddant Ed. 101· I llis quae reddunt. Lach. puts this verse
after 270, where it is quite out of place: from 107 it is manifest that the
images, not the real things, ‘ reddunt speculorum ex aequore visum.’
Lamb. and Creech think 289-291 spurious: Wak. as usual sees 110 diffi-
culty in the ms. reading and boldly calls in the Pyth agoreans to the rescue.
299-347 (323-347 299—322) were first placed in their proper order by
Lamb. after B corr. This is one of the main passages which enabled Lach.
so acutely to determine the number of lines in a page of the lost arche-
type of all our mss. These 49 verses 4- three headings amount to fifty-
two or twice twenty-six 3 that is to say the original ms. had twenty-six
lines in a page, and by some chance one leaf, the 68th, had its pages in-
verted3 hence the transposition: see introduction p. 20. Τ110 marg. of

tornum Flor. 31 2 Vat. Brix. for turnum. tortum Camb. terantur Ed.
for tuantur. tuamur Lach. but ad tornum has no sense or construction
with tuantur 01· tuamur, as Lamb. saw, who reads tornata ut for ad
tornum, a violent change. 378 abluit Brix. (2) Ver. Ven. for adluit.
395 videntur Lach. for videtur, as plur. ea follows. In small ed. I
thought that after 397 a verse was lost of this nature, Fallere saepe
animum simili ratione videmus 3 but see notes 2. Lach. reads Exstant
usque for Exstantisque. 406 tibi tum Nauger. first for ubi tum. 414
conlectus Lamb. for coniectus: see 111 198. 418 A has properly ut before
videare: 419 Corpora AB has 110 30113οτ I have therefore written Cetera
mirando 101· Corpora mirande: a very slight alteration. Flor. 31 has
mirando,· Nic. N icc. Camb. etc. miranda. Lach. seems to have misap-
prehended the matter, as in 213 and 1 1061: he reads Ut prope miraclo
for Corpora mirande, caeli 101· eaelo, and transposes the two verses. But
I have obeyed him in reading dispicere 101· despicere, as ms, authority is
of little weight 011 311011 a point: comp. 421 dispeximus AB Nic. Nice.
for desp. Virgil’s mss. both in Aen. 1 224 and georg. ΙΙ 187 are nearly
all in favour of despicere. Ph. Wagner philologus xv p. 352 quotes on
