tural,' but yet unusual application of the word: Plautus however in his
epitaph has mortem aptus est. 1238 cum. fun. suna see n. to 111 71
caedem caede accumulantes. 1239 visere ad : see n. to 11 359 revisit
Ad stabulum. But here too the argument is strange: ‘this above all
heaped death upon death 3 for those who refused to attend their own
sick, killing neglect soon aster would punish for their too great love of
life and sear of death by a foul and evil end, left to themselves without
help': he then adds naturally enough that they who did stay, caught the
infection and died. He is here following closely the order of Thuc. who
continues, εἴτε γάρ μὴ θέλοιεν δεδιότες ἀλλήλοις προσιέναι, ἀπώλλυντο
ἔρημοιῑ but instead of making οἱ πάσχοντες 110111. of ἀπώλλυντο, he
took οἱ δεδιότες προσιέναι for its subject 3 and feeling the weakness of the
argument he 1138 tricked it out with these embellishments, and given
three lines to express the two words of Thuc. The educated Romans
of Lucretius’ time had an exquisite knowledge of their own tongue, its
syntax, its grammar, its prosody, 311 its refinements and capabilities 3
they were also well acquainted with Greek, such as Greek then was ;
but the Attic of Thucydides and Sophocles, of Plato and Demosthenes
had been dead for centuries3 and Greek had become the lingua franca

of the civilised world. 1240 mortis timentis: Ι find no other instance
of this construction. 1241 Poenibat: see n. to 1v 220 moerorum.

1247—1251 appear like 1225 to be out of place and unconnected
with what precedes and follows: they refer also to the same matter as
that verse, to the neglect of the usual rites of burial: Lucr. in all this
part of his poem follows the order of Thuc.: well 1246 concludes
the topics contained in Thuc. 51 3 1252 commences the questions with
which Thuc. 52 opens: both then dwell in the same order on the crowd-
ing of people from the country into the town and the terrible mortality
caused thereby 3 speak of the dead bodies piled up in the streets and by
the fountains3 the temples crammed with corpses: Thuc. then goes on
to say νόμοι τε πάντες συνεταράχθησαν, οἷς ἐχρῶντο πρότερον περὶ τὰς
ταφάς, ἔθαπτον δὲ ὥς ἕκαστος ἐδύνατοε 80 1300 Lucr. 1278, 38 if like Thuc.
he were entering on a new question, begins Nec mos ille sepulturae cet.
and in four verses paraphrases the words just cited: Thuc. then con-
tinues, καὶ πολλοὶ ἐς ἀναισχύντους θήκας ἐτράποντο σπάνει τῶν ἐπιτηδείων
διὰ τό συχνούς ἤδη προτεθνάναι σφίσινῑ 311(1 similarly Lucr. 1282 con-
tinues his paraphrase‚ Multaque res subita cet.: Thuc. then goes on ἐπὶ
πυρᾶς γοῖρ ἀλλοτρίας, φθάσαντες τούς νήσαντας, οἱ μὲν ἐπιθέντες τὸν ἑαυτῶν
νεκρὰν ὖφῆπτονε these simple words Lucr. expresses with some poetical
embellishment in the last four vss. of his poem: Thuc. completes the
above sentence with this clause, οἱ δὲ καιομένου ἄλλου ἄνωθεν ἐπιβαλόντες
