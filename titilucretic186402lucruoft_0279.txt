Π 1770-7833 again how absurd that immortal souls should be present

at conception and fight who shall get the mortal body, unless indeed
they bargain, first come first served l 776 conubia or conubja‘l it is
not easy to decide: there is no other certain example of the word in
Lucr. as v 1013 Oonubium is introduced by conjecture: many and re-
cently Luc. Mueller de re metr. p. 258 argue for the two quantities of
the word: the latter says ‘notabile quidem debuit videri tot exempla
durissimae synizesis cur noluerint vitare poetae ponendo coniuqium vel
coniuyialem . sed enim augebitur admiratio reputantibus Lucani et
Senecae, qui numquam i vel u mutarunt in consonam, versus tales
M ox ubi conubii pretium mercesque solutast. Conubia vitat: qenus Ama-
zonium scias . porro Statius synizesin cum alibi non plus septiens admi-
serit, in uno vocabulo conubii, si productam habet semper secundam,
deciens octiens eam adhibuisse erit credendus': he further shews that
the old grammarians Consentius and Servius hold it to be short in such
cases. Prof. Conington to Aen. 1 7 3 observes ‘the analogy of pronubus
innubus might be pleaded as proving a variation of quantity3 but no
clear instance of conubium occurs except in Sidon. Ap011.’: Prudentius
also has it short 3 and Claudian a far higher metrica] authority than any
of the Christians writes epist. 11 18 Vectiyal meritae conubiale lyrae: it
is quite true that in the time of all these writers the native feeling for
quantity was utterly lost and did not then exist in the Roman world 3 it
was learnt only from tradition by Claudian and Servius as much as by
Prudentius or us3 but in reply to Conington’s pertinent remark it
might be said that the word is not used at all by Tibullus and Proper-
tius nor in his lyrics and elegiacs by Catullus 3 that Ovid has only the form
conubia in his elegiacs3 that the word in the singular or dat. and abl.
plur. occurring so often as it does in some writers, in Virgil 8, in Statius
18 times, is always found with the u in thesis, never once with it in
arsis, and that though Lucan who resolves the ii of the gen. twice uses
conubii, Virgil Aen. IV 167 chooses to say conscius aether Conubiis, not
Gonubii: it is quite possible that Virgil, and after him Ovid Statius
and the rest, may in these doubtful cases have wished not to decide a
moot point, and to leave their readers to fix it for themselves: see what
is said at 1042 on perfects like Exiit: the sensitiveness of Virgil on
doubtful points of quantity seems to have been very great3 and often
he avoids such altogether. conubia is used also by Ovid amores 11 '7 21
for concubitus. 778 immor. mor. Inn. nuni: see n. to 11 1054. 779
