recorded points agreed with him on this question as on others, such as
making the 80111 60118181 01 1116 8111611681 and roundest atoms. 374 animae
elementa: VI 755 Sed natura loci ope: comp. too Virg. geor. 11 144 teuent
oleae armentaque laeta: the only two cases where Lucr. lengthens by the
caesura a short vowel, 11 27 and V 1049, occur likewise in the middle of
the fourth foot. minora, as proved at length 179—230. 377 dum-
taoeat: see n. to 11 123. 378 Quantula has here the sense of a dimi—
nutive of quot, and: quam paucula, quam parum multa: quantulum
and quantum have often this force in the sing. : thus quantum est = quot
sunt 3 but I know no other instance of the plur. thus used 3 elsewhere in
Lucr. the word has its proper meaning, quam parvulus. 380 the
distances between each atom of 80111 will be exactly proportioned to the
fewness of the whole number compared with those of the body. exordia
animai here :exordia prima or primordia am: no ambiguity being
possible here: so 379 and in 6 hundred other places Corpora=prima
corpora.

381 Nam cet.: Lucr. does not venture to say how few they are com-
pared with those of the body 3 but these instances prove he thought the
disproportion to be very great: the foot of a gnat or a grain of dust
touching the body must touch thousands and thousands of atoms: if
then these can often fall on the body without being felt, that is without
touching any atoms of the soul, these must be vastly fewer than those
of the body. But does not the body feel as well 68 1116 801112 yes3 he
has elaborately proved already that the one feels 68 well as the other,
and that neither of the two 6611 possibly feel without the other 3 but he
has also shewn that the initus motus must proceed from the anima, and
not merely from the anima, but from that part of it which is the
animus, and not merely from the emimus, but from that fourth nameless
substance in it: the anima and animus then form one connected whole
in the body 3 if therefore any atoms of the anima are moved they will
at once communicate with the animus, and sense will commence and be
imparted to the whole anima, and from the anima to the body which
will then feel. But many atoms of the body 116 argues may be touched
without any part of the 80111 being moved, and therefore without there
being any commencement of sensation: see what presently follows,
391—395. 381 adhaesum: this word occurs three times in Lucr.
and seems to be found nowhere else: he clearly loves these substantives
in ·us. 383 aranei: this contraction is forced on him by the 116668-
sity of the metre. 387 levitate...9ravatim: see n. to 11 1054. 391
ciendum semina: another instance of this idiom so common with him:
see n. to 1 111. 393 sentiscant: IV 586 sentiscere: the word seems
to occur nowhere else. 394 tuditantia: see n. to 11 1146. 395
