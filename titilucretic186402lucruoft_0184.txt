895 Quae ‘neque florescunt...ueque suut eadem iucunda: the simpler
cases such as those quoted by Conington 1.1. where the succeeding
clauses are ‘in material, but not in formal connexion' with the relative
clause, are exceedingly numerous in Lucr.: comp. 21 foll. 58 foll.: as
indeeed in all writers 3 the Latin idiom making them not easy to avoid.

the narrowness of the channel. fretu: Gen. x111 21 15 quotes Cic.

Halm restores fretu from Pl. Lucr. V1 364 has fretus nom. '722
