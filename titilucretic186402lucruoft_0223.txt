sumptam and avertere seem to make a good antithesis: a learned friend
argues strongly for subitam, whether as an adj. ‘ emergent,’ ‘ fitful’ or as
a partic. in the sense of quae subiit. I can find no instance of the adj.
used with a meaning that would be suitable here. As for the partic.
could Ι find such a use supported by any authority, I would gladly
admit it. The use of passive participles from neuter verbs is confined
within very narrow limits: in many cases the verb still admits of being
transitive, as suesco and its compounds: this probably applies to senectus
also and the like: see n. to 111 772: or old usage has justified it 3 thus
we say occasus sol, but occisus homo: Lucr. VI 491 has inpensa: quae
inpendent 3 and this seems supported by Sen. Herc. Oet. 1592 impensum
ferrum 3 but there must have been a close connexion between the neu-
ters pendeo impendeo, and the actives pendo suspendo etc: suspensus
must have suggested itself to a Latin using inpensus. Yet in such
cases use I grant is 'the sole norma loquendi. The friend alluded to pro-
duces eoeita vita from Festus3 but then exire is often transitive, three or
four times in Lucr. 3 and ewiri is similarly used as a persona] pass. by
VitruviuS, cited to v 1330. praeteritus may be more in point 3 yet

tain quicque will not stand here ,- though I am glad to leave the decision
of so nice a question to two such illustrious scholars : it must be borne
in mind that the mss. have Quidque, which is as far from quicque as
from quique3 so that in either case we have recourse to correction.
