Alex. Aphrod. to Arist. met. p. 745 4 Bon. πολλοῖς γὰρ εὐθύνας δέδωκεν
ἦ τοὶ ἄτομα μεγέθη εἰσάγουσα δόξα. Lucr. therefore seeks to maintain
at the same time that cardinal point in the epicurean physics that
atoms are impenetrable and indestructible‚ and yet possessed of weight
shape and extension, and to shew how particles thus endowed are inca-
pable of further division : atoms have parts, but these parts are minima,
the ἐλάχιστα of Epicurus, not able to exist alone, abiding therefore in
the atom from all eternity in unchangeable juxta-position.

599 extr. quodque cac. Corp. ill. :extremum cacumen, suum cuiusque,
corporibus illis, since cuiusque could not be joined with Corporis illius:
it resembles therefore 578 quaeque...corp0ra rebus 3 and seems to me to
involve just the same principle as the use of suus quisque illustrated by
Madvig de fin. p. 699 and Lach. to 11 371 : thus Cic. de fin. v 46 says
cuiusque partis naturae . . sua quaeque vis sit, the first cuiusque making
it not possible for him to say sua cuiusque vis. 600 Corporis etc. is
of course the atom: corpora or corpora prima we have already found to
be among his commonest terms for his atoms: 483 Corpora sunt porro
partim primordia rerum3 and so Stobaeus l.1. and Plut. de plac. phil. 1
3 p. 877 D say that Epicurus defined τοῖς οἷρχάς τῶν ὄντων σώματα λόγῳ
θεωρητά κ.τ.λ. : corpus is thus used in the sing. in 606 naturam corporis,
and 11 484 cuiusvis in brevitate Corporis, and 490 totius corporis eius:
though our present passage has been grievously misunderstood, the
words added would seem to preclude any doubt, as well as the tenour of
the whole passage: illius qu. n. c. s. I am nequeunt he says3 and so 11
312 Omnis enim Zonye nostris ab sensibus infra Primorum natura iacet;
quapropter ubi ipsa Cernere iam nequeas: the iam implying that when
you arrive at the atom, it is already far below the ken of sense. With
this passage must be compared 749 foll. where he is blaming those who
refuse to admit a limit to the division of things, Cum videamus id extre-
mum cuiusque cacumen Esse quod ad sensus nostros ‘minimum esse vide-
tur, Conicere ut possis επ hoc, quae cernere non quis Extremum quod
habent minimum consistere in illis: then with this passage and the other
must be compared Epicurus’ own words in Diog. Laert. x 58 τό τ’
ἐλάχιστον τὸ ἐν αἰσθήσει δεῖ κατανοεῖν ὅτι οὔτε τοιοῦτόν ἐστιν οἷον τό τοῖς
μεταβάσεις ἔχον οὔτε πάντως ἀνόμοιον, ἀλλ’ ἔχον μέν τινα κοινότητα τῶν
μεταβάντων διάληψιν δὲ μερῶν οὐκ ἔχον...ταύτῃ τῇ οἷναλογίᾳ νομιστέον καὶ
τό ἐν τῇ ἀτόμῳ ἐλάχιστον κεχρῆσθαι· μικρότητι γοῖρ ἐκεῖνο δῆλον αἷς διαφέρει
τοῦ κατὰ τήν αἴσθησιν θεωρουμένου, ἀναλογίᾳ, δὲ τῇ αὐτῇ κέχρηται· ἐπείπερ
καὶ ὅτι μέγεθος ἔχει ἦ ἄτομος κατοὶ τὴν ἐνταῦθα ἀναλογίαν κατηγορήσαμεν,
μικρόν τι μόνον, μακρὸν ἐκβάλλοντες. Epicurus and Lucr. are each com-
paring the ἐλάχιστον or minimum of an atom with the ἐλάχιστον or
minimum in a visible thing. What is the cacumen of Lucr. in 599 and
7492 Epicurus wrote περὶ τῆς ἐν τῇ οἶτόμῳ γωνίας, where he doubtless
