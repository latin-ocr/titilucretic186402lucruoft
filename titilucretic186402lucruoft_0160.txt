tuere: comp. cimus above. 301 Usur. oc. ε 1v 97 5 sensibus usurpare. ⁵

Plautus too has neque oculis neque pedibus neque oculis usurpavi: see

Foro. 306 eaedem: eadem and eodem are found as ‚dissyL in Lucr. as 'j

well as idem (plur.) and isdem. dispansae: dispessus is also used by 2³³·

Lucr. serescunt: this passage is quoted by Nonius 1753 and it seems

to be the only known use of the word: serenus is clearly connected with
it and Nonius adds ‘inde Vergilius docte georg. 1 [461] unde serenas ,ςζςζι

Ventus aqat nubes’, having just explained serescit by siccatur. 30¹7
umor umidus umecto and umerus are rightly read in A B. 311-314
comp. Ov. ars 1 473 Ferreus adsiduo consumitur anulus usu. Interit 52·

adsidua vomer aduncus humo. 312 anulus, not ann. habendo has

not the same subject as the sentence: so Virg. georg. 11 250 lentescit
habendo: comp. also 1v 1102 N ec satiare queunt spectando corpora ἱ,.’
coram3 1068 Ulcus enim vivescit et inveterascit alendo3 and Virgil’s ζῑ

9endo blandeque colendo of the earth3 Plaut. asin. 222 Bene salutando
consuescunt, compellando blanditer, Ausculando. 313 Stilicidi: Lach.

in a masterly note shews that when a long vowel is followed by ll, one l [j.

is withdrawn when an i follows, if this i be not merely the mark of a
case, as villa ‘m'llisz thus Messalla Messalina 3 mille milia 3 villa vilicus : ⁷⁷

stilla stilicidium 3 for stiria shews that the i of stilla is long. According ¹
to this rule Polio is right, and Servius recognises both Polio and Pollio,- Ι f·

and Πωλίων 18 the usual Greek form 3 but Roman usage seems finally to :1
have declared for Pollio3 in the new corpus inser. Lat. vol. 1 Pollio is s
found 6 timeS, Polio once3 in Mommsen's inscr. reg. Neapol. always ζῇ

Pollio 3 and so the mss. of virgil 3 but Pal. and Med. fail in the four

which seems of course natural enough. 318 the meaning is by the .⁷'
touch of the great numbers who in passing kiss: the words rather imply ⁸
‘ of those who often kiss' 3 but it comes in the end to the same thing. ”
321 praeclusit: this verb he uses v 373 111 its literal sense of shutting ’
