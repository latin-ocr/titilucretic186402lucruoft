δασκεν, οὔκ ἅν ποτ’ εἴχομεν ὅ τι μεμψαίμεθα αὐτοῖς πανταχόθεν εἰσπληρου-
μένοις τῶν ἡδονῶν κ.τ.λ. : Hor. epist. 1 16 65 qui cupiet, metuet quoque ε
Seneca has many similar common-places. 25 finem within which
they may be indulged 3 beyond which peace of mind cannot exist. 26
bonum summum, being in great measure the finem cupp. atque tim. of
25: Epic. 1. 1. 128 refers this ἐπὶ τήν τοῦ σώματος ὖγίειαν καὶ τὴν τῆς
ψυχῆς ἀταραξίαν, ἐπεὶ τοῦτο τοῦ μακαρίως ζῆν ἐστὶ τέλος...τήν ἡδονήν ἀρχὴν
καὶ τέλος λέγομεν εἶναι τοῦ μακαρίως ζῆν. But, like Lucr.‚ he goes on to
explain that, when he says pleasure is the end and chief good, he does
not mean such pleasure as the ignorant or malevolent allege he does,
but, l. l. 131 τὸ μήτ’ οἷλγεῖν κατὰ σῶμα μήτε ταράττεσθαι κατὰ ψυχήν, and
132 νήφων λογισμὸς καὶ τὰς αἰτίας ἐξερευνῶν πάσης αἱρέσεως καὶ φυγῆς καὶ
τοὶς δόξας ἐξελαύνων κ.τ.λ., but above all φρόνησις ἐξ ἧς αἱ λοιπαὶ πᾶσαι
πεφύκασιν οἷρεταί, διδάσκουσαι ὥς οὔκ ἔστιν ήδέως ζῆν ἄνευ τοῦ φρονίμως

exclasrnaturum ‘ dulce est et ad me nil pertine& we may doubt whether a
stoic could go much farther. 2¹7 tramite parvo z see Lach. : doubtless
Epicurus, and probably in his work περὶ τέλους, taught that to true
wisdom and happiness there was but one narrow way, to error many
broad ones : Hor. sat. 11 3 48 ubi passim Palantes error certo de tramite
pellit cet. 31 Seu casu seu vi are two expressions for the same
thing, the inexorable chance or necessity, called v 77 natura qubernans,
107 fortuna yubernans, by which all things go on ; ὅλως πρόνοιαν μή
εἶναι μηδὲ εἱμαρμένην, οἷλλοὶ πάντα κατὰ αὐτοματισμὸν γίνεσθαι, says Hip-
pol. ref. haer. 1 22 of Epicurus: see n. to V 77 ε the κατ’ αὐτοματισμόν is

43—95 ε once more I mount my chamot, to tell what remains to be
told of the things which go on above US, and to dispel the causeless fears
of men who believe such things to be tokens of divine wrath ε the gods
will indeed plague you, if you so believe 3 not that they will themselves
do you any burt, but the images proceeding from their holy bodies will
stir up these vain fears and poison existence. 1 have now therefore to
sing of thunder‚ of tempests, of other things that take place in the sky.
