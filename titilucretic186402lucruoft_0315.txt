cet: that this was also the doctrine of Democritus is abundantly shewn
in Theophr. de sensu et sensil. 65, 66, 67 and elsewhere. 624 Umida
sudantia is very Lucretian: comp. candens lacteae, caudens lucidus and
the like. templa: V 103 humanum iu pectus templaque mentis: see n.
to I 120: the linquar? templa may have reference to the shape and posi-
tion of the palate and the Greek οὐρανός. 627 flue =ten11s‚ a rare use
illustrated by Bentl. to Hor. od. 11 18 30: he cites Ovid ex Ponto I 4
28 Thessaliae fine.

633—672 : I will now explain why what is one creature's meat is
another's poison: all creatures differ within and without 3 therefore they
consist of different atoms 3 and the atoms being different, the pores and
’ passages of the whole body, and also of the mouth and palate must
differ: thus if food is pleasant to one creature, its smooth elements
must suit the pores of that creature 3 if unpleasant, then its rough ele-
ments must more readily adapt themselves to them: and thus in disease,
what was before sweet to 6 111611 may become bitter. 633 almus: II 390
liquor almus aquarum. 634 quareve 3 see n. to 1 57 Quove. triste: see 11.

what Lucr. teaches here: Theophr. de sensu et sensil. 63 σημεῖον δὲ ὦς

πνέοι veracity. 638 serpeus: Pliny nat. hist. VII 15 cited by Lamb.‚
