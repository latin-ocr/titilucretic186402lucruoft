The last eight verses are to be noticed, as bearing not only on what
precedeS‚ but also on what follows in this book about the sun and moon,
and in the sixth about thunder clouds and other celestial phenomena.
On comparing Epicurus' letter to Pythocles in Diog. Laer. x 84 foll. it
will be found that master and pupil are in precise agreement on this as
on most matters. The contempt which Epicurus had for astronomers
and other system-mengers and the doctrine he held with regard to μετέ-
ωρα 15 0116 of the most curicus features of his philosophy. Whatever
could be brought to the test of sense and was confirmed by it was true 3
all opinions again which could not be brought to such test and at the
same time were not contradicted by it were to be held to be equally
true. Now to apply this to the present question: he says 1. l. 86 it is a
certain truth that the universe consists of body and void and that atoms
are indivisible : so with all things ὅσα μοναχὴν ἔχει τοῖς φαινομένοις συμ-
φωνίαν, ὅπερ ἐπὶ τῶν μετεώρων οὐχ ὑπάρχει· ἀλλὰ ταῦτά γε πλεοναχὴν ἔχει
καὶ τῆς ’γενέσεως αἰτίαν καὶ τῆς οὐσίας ταῖς αἰσθήσεσι σύμφωνον κατηγορίαν.
οὗ γοῖρ κατ’ ἀξιώματα κενοὶ καὶ νομοθεσίας φυσιολογητέον, ἀλλ’ ὥς τοὶ φαινό-
μενα ἐκκαλεῖται, and then he goes on to give this reason, οὗ γὰρ δή ἰδιο-
λογίας καὶ κενῆς δόξης ὁ βίος ήμῶν ἔχει χρείαν, ἀλλὰ τοῦ ἀθορύβως ἦμᾶς
ζῆν. His doctrines then of body and void and the nature of atoms are
certain truths which admit of but one explanation because every pheno-
nemon here 011 6311311 attests them, and by most certain induction and
reason they can be extended to the whole universe, alike to what is
below and what is beyond our sense. Again it is a certain truth that
the sun is really about the same size as it appears to us to be: see Epic.
1.1. 91, Lucr. v 564—591 : because from the experiments you can
make with fire here on earth and the fact that so long as it is visible it
does not diminish in size‚ but sooner indeed loses its brightness, you can
by reason and induction apply these facts to the sun and the stars.
Again that our world was formed nearly in the manner just described
by Lucr. is true, because earth water air fire of which it is composed
always do and must in like circumstances act in the way they are there
represented as acting. But to say that the stars and the sun must move
from some one controlling cause, or that eclipses can admit of only one
explanation, or that lightning and clouds can be formed in only one way
is a vain unphilosophical assumption, since they are beyond our powers
of observation and there are many ways of explaining them equally pro-
bable‚ 130 which οὐδὲν τῶν φαινομένων ἀντιμαρτυρεῖ, 01· οὐθὲν τῶν ἐναργη-
μάτων διαφωνεῖ and the like: you must not then fear τοὶς ἀνδραποδώδεις
τῶν ἀστρολόγων τεχνιτείας; to give one explanation καθῆκόν ε’στι τοῖς
