which is repeated in 2 Vat. Brix. Ver. Ven. Ald. 1 and 2, J unt. : the last
three read Atqui. Avanc. however at the end of his Catullus rightly

and VI 25 cupedinis. Again Ven. 1101 Brix. or Ver. torpedine here.
This therefore is one of many proofS, some of which I have given else-
where, that Gifanius had the old Venice edition with Marullus’ ms.
notes before him, and that this is the book belonging to Sambucus of
which he speaks both in his preface to Sambucus himself and in his
address to the reader: see above p. 8. It is also a proof that we are
not to give 10 Marullus’ all the new readings of the J untine, whether
good or bad. 1001 e summo iam vertice Avanc. for summo iam vertice.

1011 I believe some verses are lost. Both the words of Servius to Aen.
vl 596 and his context prove 10 me that he is speaking of Lucretius, not
of Virgil as Bernays affirms in Rhein. Mus. n. f. v p. 584, when he says
‘ per rotam autem ostendit negotiatores qui semper tempestatibus tur-
binibusque volvuntur.’ It is quite possible his account is vague and in-.
accurate, and that Ixion would have to be mentioned rather before, than
after 1011. I have appended the mark of a hiatus and made no change
in the text. For eqesias of all mss. and of Brix. and Ver., Ven. has
the remarkable reading eyenus, adopted by Ald. 1 J unt. Lamb. vulg.
Lach., but it is of course a pure conjecture which Lach. wrongly gives
to Marullus. 1013 Qui neque. Quid ‚2 neque Lach. Haec neque J unt.
