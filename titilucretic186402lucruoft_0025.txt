IN TRODUCTION 7

iacet, indique, exsors Amicii, infirmusque pedum infirmusque palati.
Then imitating at once and contradicting Lucretius’ ut aecumst, Cui
tantum in vita ‘restet cet. 116 goes on Atque uno non tantum infelix, quod
sua damna Non capit et quantum superat perferre laborum. This the last
poem published in his lifetime is full from beginning to end of Lucretian
phraseology. In this edition too he inserts two new verses in the
poem ‘de poetis Latinis’ spoken of above, Natura maqni versibus Lu-
cretii Lepore musaeo illicis, the best in the poem and recalling musaeo
eontinyens cuncta lepore. Crinitus 1.1. ΧΧΙΠ 7 quotes this poem and
mentions a conversation he had with Marullus in which ‘ factum est
iudicium nuper a nostro Marullo de poetis Latinis egregie perfectum et
prudenter’, and Ovid and other poets are blamed ; and then it is added
‘itaque legendi quidem sunt omnes inquit [Marullus] 3 sed hi maxime
probandi pro suo quisque genere, Tibullus Horatius Catullus et 111
comoedia Terentius. Vergilium vero et Lucretium ediscendos asserebat'.
Let what has just been said be at once applied to a striking interpola-
tion. After 1 15 the J untine first inserted the v. Illecebrisque tuis
omnis natura animantum, which long kept its place in the common edi-
tions. Lachmann of course attributes it to Marullus, as do most edi-
tors. Lambinus says of it ‘neque eum Naugerius neque Pontanus
habuerunt. Marullus unus vir doctus ex auctoritate veteris cuiusdam
codicis, quemadmodum mihi religiose asseveravit Donatus IanottuS,
nobis eum restituit. amicus quidam meus ingenio et doctrina praestan-
tissimus putat esse ab ipso Marullo factum cet.' What his authority
is for that which he says of Pontanus I do not know, but Naugerius
editor of the Aldine of 1515 properly omits the line, though he in general
minutely copies the J untine. Now this line is written by the hand of
Angelo Politian in the margin of a manuscript which belonged to him
and forms xxxv 29 of the Laurentian library. Politian died in sep-
tember 1494, when Marullus could hardly yet have done much for Lucre-
tius 3 and besides this as he had been long the deadly enemy of Politian,
it is not likely the latter would have inserted in his manuscript one of
his verses. Ι conclude therefore that it is Politian's own 3 and as Can-
didus says in 1113 preface that he collated all the ‘ vetusta exemplaria' 111
Florence, he could not have neglected this manuscript which was then
in the famous conventual library of San Marco. Ι conclude therefore
that Gandidus’ taking it from the margin of Politian's ms. is the right
explanation of Ianottus’ assertion that Marullus got it from an ancient
codex. It is quite possible indeed that Marullus copied it himself from
this ms. which passed to San Marco immediately after Politian’s de-
cease, and thus robbed him of his verse after death, as he had robbed
him of his bride during life. Naugerius has in his first page another
variation from the J untine, but that a perverse one: in 1 7 he reads
Adventuque tuo and joins it with what follows. This corruption ἶ
believe to proceed from Marullus 3 for his hymn to the sun contains a
passage which evidently comes from Lucretius: Cum primum tepidi sub
tempora verna favoni Aura suum terris yenitalem exuscitat auctum .· Ad-
ventuque dei gemmantia prata colorat .· Ac pecudum yenue omne viyet, yenus
omne virorum Perculsi teneras anni dulcedine mentes. Ι can shew in other
cases that Marullus corrupted LucretiUS, where he has not been followed
