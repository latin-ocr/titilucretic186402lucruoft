51 fulyorem ab auro, the glitter coming from gold: see passages quoted
there from Livy and others: it: therefore non a nulla ratione pro-
ficisci, non nullius rationis esse: or has it the meaning of stare, esse a
ratione, a parte rationis? or is it like Cic. pro Mur. 63 nostri illi a
Platone et Aristotele 2 but that is perhaps a mere Grecism. 936 taetra
denotes esp. what is nauseous to taste or smelL 941 dec. non cap. in
form resembles Enn. ann. 360 N ec cum capta capi cet. imitated in Aen.
V11 295 Num eapti potuere capi cet. but the sense differs: it is rightly
explained perhaps by Turneb. adv. VI 14 ‘tractum esse videtur a feris
avibus piscibus 3 nam fovea pedica nassa area esca decipiuntur atque
capiuntur, in damnumque et incommodum incidunt: non tamen pueri
cet.’ Tasso Ger. lib. 1 3 E dall’ inqanno suo vita rieeve: Fairfax re-
produces better the point of Lucr. They drinke deceivd and so deceivd
they live. Aen. 1V 330 Non equidem omnino capta ac deserta viderer,
capta is much stronger than decepta would be. 944 Tristior=ama-
rior: IV 125 tristia centaurea 3 634 quod triste et amarumst5 VI 780

- saporeque tristia quae sint 3 Virg. geor. 111 448 tristi amurca. 945

suav. Pierio, . musaeo dulci: see n. to 258. 949 dum perspicis is the
idiomatic tense: Cic„ ad Att. x 3 090 in Arcano opperior, dum haec
coynosc503 Ter. eun. 206 eoepectabo, dum venit3 Virg. ecl. IX 23 dum
redeo . . pasce capellas: sometimes it is doubtful whether dum siguifies
‘ until’ or ‘ whilst'3 but here and in the passages just quoted and IV 24
dum perspicis 0. N. r. ae persentis utilitatem it plainly means ‘until ’.
950 compta: 111 258 quo pacto inter sese mixta quibusque Compta modis
viqeant3 IV 27 quibus e rebus cum corpore compta viyeret ; and 111 845
qui comptu coniuqioque Corporis atque animae consistimus uniter apti:
the metaphor must be from dressing and braiding‚ and building up a
complicated structure with, a head of hair.

951—95'7: ‘ I have proved the existence of indestructible atoms and
of void or space: are these atoms infinite in number? is this space
infinite in extent 2’ 957 profundum in Lucr. means unfathomably
deep, and hence is almost synon. with immensus: comp. his use of solidus,
plenus, celer, maynus and the like in n. to IV 63.

958-987; well then the universe is bounded on no side 3 for then it
must have 011 end or outside 3 in which case there must be something
beyond it, which may be seen to bound it3 but there can be nothing
outside the universe, which is therefore boundless on all sides. Again
say for the moment space is finite: go now to its verge and fling a
javelin: will it go in the direction you throw it, or will it be stopped by
something? if there is something beyond to stop it, that something is in
the universe 5 if it goes on, it has not started from the end of space:
therefore you will be always in the universe, wherever you fling it.
Lastly whatever you see, is bounded by and into something different3
