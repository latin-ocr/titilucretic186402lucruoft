Aen. IX 190. 4¹7 comp. Manil. v 10 Cum semel aethereos iussus cort-
sce‘ndere currus Samum contiyerim sua per fastigia culmen3 for he is
commencing his last book. 48 ex ira ut plac. : Aen. VI 407 tumida

also v 898 : Aen. VI 283 is very similar, but hamher, quam sedem som-
‘nia volyo Vana tenere jerunt foliisque sub omnibus haerent. 53 De-

applies here as well ε 35-41 are we saw likewise a mere repetition 3 as
are 87—89 below3 and the whole paragraph has much of that dis-
jointed character of which we there spoke‚ as characteristical of so many
of his introductory passages3 nor in stating 83 foll. what is to be the
subject of this book does he allude to one half of the questions really

not a common construction, but Lach. illustrates it from Cic. de sen. 4
