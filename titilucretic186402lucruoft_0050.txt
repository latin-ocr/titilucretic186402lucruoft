for this form. perniciali vulg, and Lach. 453 sawist Lach. saxi esc
Wak. for samis. 454 Lach. has proved to be spurious as a nomin. intactus
cannot exist, and the datives are not consistent with the genitives of
453. Lamb. reads saxis, calor iqnibu’, liquor aquai: but Lucr. never
uses a dat. in ai. 465 Troiiaqenas, 4¹76 Troiianis, 477 Graiiuqena‘rum

489 Lach. strangely reads caelum, p. s. domorum Ol. it, as if the air,
like a stone wall, were a good instance of a very solid thing. All mss.
have caeli and ut. ac Avanc. first for ad. 491 ferventia J unt. and
Lamb. ed. 1 for ferventi. 492 tum Brix. Ver. Ven. for cum.

old form of vacaret: see F. Buecheler Rhein. Mus. n. f. xm p. 583 etc.

vocatio were in use for vacuus etc. 525 Distinetamst, quoniam Lamb.
most rightly for Distinctum quoniam which Lach. retains beginning the
apodosis with sunt erqo in 526. Ald. 1 and J unt. seem to take dis-
tinctam for distinctum est and to understand the passage rightly. 527
pleno Ald. 1 and J unt. for poena, and inane for inani. 533 findi Flor.

551—628: J unt. puts 577—583 after 628, and 551—564 after 583.
At the end of his edition Candidus says ‘ Marulli nos hoc loco ordinem,
atque item alibi in plerisque, ubi immutatum quid offenderis, secutos
esse'. The learned annotator of Flor. 32 says in the margin to 550
that some put 551-564 after 576, and adds ‘verum Marullo parum
referre videtur quomodo legatur’, shewing again that there were
different traditions about Marullus. Lamb. places only 577—583 after
628. All these transpositions are utterly wrong, though Candidus says
of Marullus ‘ quem profecto, si ad amussim rem quanque examinabis,
neutiquam (sic opinor) repudiaveris’. 555 ad auctum Ed. These words
came at the end of page 23 of the archetype from which all Mss. are
derived, and therefore were at the outside margin and, as has happened
in so many cases, were torn away by some accident. Some one then
filled up the verse with finis which occurs three times at the end of a
line in the next thirty verses. Lach. keeps finis and for summum reads
samma which he thus awkwardly explains, ‘summa, hoc est universo
vivendi actU, aetatis pervadere fines, per omne vitae spatium vadere’.
summum..florem, J unt. Lamb. ed. 1 and 2, Oreech etc. which Lach.
proves could only mean ‘ pass through' not ‘ arrive at the fiower'. sum-
mum...finem Flor. 30 ex corr. Ver. Ven. Lamb. ed. 3 Wak. etc. This is
doubly wrong, as finis in Lucretius is always feminine. 566 possit Ed.
