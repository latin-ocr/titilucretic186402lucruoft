quam sis moriturus: I- doubt whether 1· have done right in reading
peryas for peryes of mss. in deference to Lamb. and Lach.: see n. to 11
36 iacteris...cubanclum est: here the decisive future, followed by the
more hesitatin g potential sis moriturus in a case which must ever
continue doubtful, appears to suit the context. Lamb. kept perqes, as
iacteris, in ed. 13 but tacitly changed both in ed, 3: Lach. makes no
objection to iacteris. 948 Omnia cet: 1090 licet quot vis vivendo
vincere saecla 3 Ι 202 Multaque vivendo vitalia vincere saecla, where see
11. 950 intendere litem is a legal phrase 3 the intentio being the for-
mal claim with which the accuser concluded‚ when he called on the
judge to condemn the defendant in such and such a penalty: Gaius IV

ται, To) δὲ παρέοντα..,οἷμαλδύνουσι; comp. too Eur. Hipp. 183 013δὲ σ’

tial. 963 incilet, an old word found in Attius Pacuvius Lucilius..
966 Nec quisquam cet. but his matter is used for the growth of other
things, 967 Materies opus est: see n. to 1 1051. 969 ante haec:
these very things which now fiourish by your decay, have in other com-
binations fallen themselves as you now fall, and in future combinations
will fall again. 971 every one has th'e usus, and not only the usus,

but the usus et fructus 3 for usu is doubtless put with poetical brevity ·

for usufructu: ususfructus, says the digest, est ius alienis rebus utendi
fruendi, salva rerum substanitia: the usus was much more limited 3 the
fructus includes the usus, not the usus the fruct-us. Curius says to
Cicero ad fam. VII 29 1 sum enim χρήσει μὲν tuus, κτήσει δὲ Attici nostri 3
erqo fructus est tuu8‚ mancipium illius 3 and Cicero replies in 30 2 cuius
[Attici] quoniam proprium te esse scribis mancipio et nexo, meum autem
usu et fructu, contentus isto sum . id est enim cuiusque proprium, quo
quisque fruitur atque utitur: but nature gives to none the mancipium γ’
ex jure Quiritium, the full and absolute ownership of life3 life is only
lent 3 its usufruct as the digest says is only ius alienis rebus utendi
fruendi 3 man is never (lominus 3 nature keeps the dominium to herself :
quaedam, si credis consultis, mancipat usus, says Horace, but not life 3
no usucapio is in force here: οὔτι γοὶρ κεκτήμεθα “Ημε’τερον αὔτὸ πλήν
