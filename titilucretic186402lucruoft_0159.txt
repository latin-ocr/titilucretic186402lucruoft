Propertius and perhaps others. For this use of et in Cicero see Madv.
de fin. p. 177. 281 soli: there are three similes in the Iliad, Δ 452,
Ε 87, Λ 492, each of which, especially the two last, Lucr. may here have
had in his mind: ποταμῷ πλήθοντι εὀικιός Χειμάρρῳ ὅστ’ ὦκα ῥέων ἐκέ-
. ὃασσε γεφύρας· Τόν δ’ οὔτ’ ἄρ τε γέφυραι ἐεργμέναι ἰσχανόωσιν, Οὕτ’ ἄρα
' ἕρκεα ἴσχει ἀλωάων ἐριθήλεων Ἐλθόντ’ ἐξαπίνης, ὅτ’ ἐπιβρίσῃ Διός ὄμβρος
and πλήθων ποταμὸς πεδίονδε κάτεισιν Χειμάρρους κατ’ ὄρεσφιν ὀπαζόμε-
νος Διός ὄμβρῳ, Πολλοῖς δὲ δρῦς ἀζαλέας, πολλοῖς δέ τε πεύκας Ἐσφέρεται,
Virg. Aen. XII 523 ubi decursu rapido de montibus altis cet. was thinking
of 283 3 and so was Spenser faerie queene 11 11 18 Like a qreat waterfloocl
that tombliny low From tlte Myle, mouutaius etc. 281 Lamb. joins ‘mollis
with aquae, but I incline to think the usage of Lucr. requires it to agree
rather with natura3 as Π 232 corpus aquae ‘naturaque tenvis Aeris 3
v 148 Teuvis euim natura deum 3 11 646 Omnis euim divom natura,
where see note. ‘natura aquaezsimply aqua 3 so natura animi, deum,
and the like again and again. 284 coniciens is used in its first meaning
also VI 731 Nubila coniciunt in 3 so coniectus the particip. more than
once. 287 M obibus are of course the piers of the bridges 3 and yra‘ndia
saxa in 289 are the stenes of these and the other parts of the bridges
swept away by the flood. 287 validis cum viribus occurs in Enn. ann.
301: Virg. Aen. v 368 has vastis cum viribu33 Cic. Arat. 146 funestum
⁸ mayuis cum viribus amnem which Lucr. may have had in mind: 195
Cicero writes validis viribus austrum without cum, VI 73 placida cum
pace quietos, 279 ipse sua cum Mobilitate calescit are like in principle 3
and VI 1233 maesto cum corde iacebant. Cicero in his Aratea quite
revels in this use of cum: in the few hundred lines which remain I have
counted 23 instances more or less similar to those quoted. 288 dat
straqem: see n. to IV 41. sub undis...volvit is found in Aen. 1 100.
289 aqua which is used above three times in this simile, is here in contrast
to venti quoque of next verse. Lamb. Bentl. and Wagner lect. Verg. in
‘ Philologus suppl. Ι p. 366 in vain defend the ms. reading qua quidquid:
Bentl. compares Ovid met. VIII 342 Spar-aitque canes ut quisque ruenti
Obstat 3 but there quisque is each of the particular dogs mentioned: here
aliquid, not quicque or its synonyme quicquid, would be required 3 again
mss. have quidquid, not quicquid: see n. to 23 quicquam. 291 pro-
cumbit is used of the wind in same sense VI 558. 293 Virg. Aen. V11 567
has torto vertice torrens, and Lucr. is purposely using terms common to
rivers and windS. vertice torto and rotanti turbiue seem to be the same
thing 3 and the tautology is like that in 275. 296 moribus: Virg.
georg. 1 51 Ventos et varium caeli praediscere morem3 which Pliny nat.
hist. XVIII 206 thus expresses quippe Veryilio iubente praedisci ventas·
ante omnia ac siderum mores. 297 aperto the opposite to caecus.
300 tuimur: also tuantur tuere are found in Lucr. for tueantur
