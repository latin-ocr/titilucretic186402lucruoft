MY DEAR DR KENNEDY‚

On the completion of a work which has cost both .
, thought and labour I gladly dedicate it to yom to whom indirectly
it owes so much. Many years have passed since the days when
I was among your earliest pupils at Shrewsbury3 but the
memory of the benefits then received from your instructions is
as fresh as ever( A succession of scholars year after year from
that time to this will bear testimony to the advantages which
they have derived from your zeal skill and varied knowledge;
and over and above all from that something higher which gave
to what was taught life and meaning and interest: denn es musz
von Herzen gehen, was auf Herzen wirken will.

The present edition claims as you will see to do something
both for the criticism and for the· explanation of the poem. After
the masterly work of Lachmann you will think perhaps that too
much space has been allotted to the former3 but that portion of
the book is intended partly to give the reader in a condensed
shape the results of his labourS, partly to add to and correct them
where circumstances or design rendered them incomplete. The
scandalous negligence with which Havercamp and Wakefield
executed what they professed to undertake has made their editions
worse than useless as the reader who trusts to them is only
betrayed and led into error. What Lachmann performed is known
