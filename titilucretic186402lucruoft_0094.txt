nuptis nunc dant sollertiu' sponsi Ed. in small edition for nudant sollera
tius ipsi, where a foot is wanting: any emendation must be quite un-
certain here 3 but with sollertiusposi for sollertius ipsi, VI 749 piso AB
for ipso might be compared, and perhaps 111 198. nune se nudant soller-
tius ipsi Lach. ε this can hardly be right. nunc dant aliis solertius ipsi
J unt. and vulg: this I now retain, as more than one friend in whose
judgment and knowledge I place much confidence, declare it to be
right. ‘ipsi nocet sententiae' says Lach. and so I still think 3 but am
now inclined to believe it may be an inaccuracy of the poet himself, not
01 his copyists. The use of ipse for or together with sponte and the like,
to denote what one does of his own free choice, not forced by another,
which Prof. Conington speaks of to Virg. ecl. IV 21 and Wagner quaest.
Verg. XV111 m. illustrates, is familiar enough and is sound in Lucretius,
as II 1090 natura videtur Libera continuo dominis privata superbis
Ipsa sua per se sponte omnia dis affere empers,· 1157 nitidas fruyes vine-
taque laeta Sponte sua primum mortalibus ipsa creavit, Ipsa dedit dulcis
fetus et pabula laeta,· IV 131 Sunt etiam quae sponte sua 9i9nuntur et
ipsa Constituuntur in lioc caelo 3 but any sense the word could bear in
our present passage appears to me essentially different: these sons of
earth, though they took the poison inprudentes, unwittingly, took it just
as much sponte, liberi, non coacti, as men now-a—days give it to others.
Again the absence 01 any word in the second clause to answer to Illi 111
the first is very hamb, to say the least 3 and it is perhaps only because
aliis has so long had a place in the common eds. that it seems more
natural than another reading. But the poet may have inprudens con-
founded the notion of doing a thing without knowing the consequences
with that of doing it because compelled by another to do it.
