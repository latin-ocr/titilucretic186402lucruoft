1118 of Hippocrates de nat. hom. 2 ἐγῶ δέ φημι, εἶ ἓν ἦν ἅνθρωπος,
οὐδέποτ’ ἂν ἥλγεε· οὐδὲ γσῖρ ἂν ἦν ὕφ’ ὅτου ἀλγήσειε ἓν ε’ὦν.

973—990: if sense must be given to the elements of living things
in order that these things may have sense, then must their elements
have the same passions and reasoning powers which men have3 they
will thus have to consist of other elements, and these again of others on
to infinity: if all this is absurd‚ and you cannot conceive laughing or
thinking atoms, why not allow generally things that have sense to come
from elements without sense? 975 propritim, another ἅπαξ λεγόμ.;
011 these adverbs see n. to 1 20 yeneratim: analogy would lead us to expect
a form propt-itus. The argument is, if sense generally must come from
sense, then the special sense of man should come from elements specially
endowed with similar sense, the power of laughing crying thinking.
976 977 comp. 1 919 920, 111 substance the same. 978 rerum mix-
tura, the way in which the elements of things are mixed to form these
things. 979 even as we are now doing. 983 sequar....ut sit:
sequar seems to have the pregnant sense of pressing the adversary and
requiring him to admit, insequar et flayitabo ut: comp. 1 980 Hoc pacto

991—1022: nay we men, as well as beasts and the fruits of the
earth, may be said to have our birth from heaven as father, and earth
who as mother gives us food and therefore life: death too is but the
going back of our elements to heaven and earth respectively : then in a
moment all forms and colours and senses perish‚ which depend on the
motions arrangements etc. of first-beginnings 3 even as in this our poem ³
a few letters produce by different arrangements etc. quite different '
verses.— The first part of this passage is a litera] translation of a frag- 33
ment from the Chrysippus of Anaxagoras' scholar Euripides, Γαΐα με· J

tration of that similar passage about the antiquity of the doctrine that s
heaven is the father and earth the mother of all things. Arist. (10
plantis 1 2 p. 817 27 expressly states that Anaxagoras taught ὅτι ἦ γῆ “
μήτηρ μέν ἐστι τῶν φυτῶν, ὁ δὲ ἥλιος πατήρ. Euripides repeats the same J
sentiment in a fragment of the Melanippe worth comparing. The whole s
of our passage is quite epicurean and consistent with the general argu- ‚
