192 Nom-Es 11

62—'792 ‘and now Ι will explain the motion of atoms, how thereby
everything comes into and goes out of being ε matter is not inseparably
united 3 it is ever going to or coming from things : every individua] is
thus changing‚ while the whole remains the same'. 62 Nunc aye...
Expediam is thus used by Virg. geor. 1v 149 3 but the phrase recurs
also in Lucr. VI 495 and 738. yenitalia‚ qiynant, yenitas. 65 mobili-
tas is his usual word for swiftness of motion: literally great power,
facility of moving: he uses also mobilis mobiliter and mobilius: he
has prob. selected the word for this technical purpose, because neither
velocitas nor celeritas would suit the metre ε levitas he also uses in the
same sense. 6'7 inter se stipata has, like so many other terms we have
noted in Lucr., a pregnant meaning, so massed together as not to admit
of separation: 1 345 Undique materies quoniam stipata quiesset: atoms
are not united together, as the parts of each atom are united in the
atom 3 1 610 Quae minimis stipata cohaerent partibus arte. 68 ma-
teries is of course here as elsewhere the collective term for atoms. 69
fluere in this sense of wasting, ebbing away is a favourite expression of
Lucr. '79 omnia becomes here the object to subducere. '71 summa
and '75 rerum summa have their proper sense of the whole sum or uni-
verse of things in being 3 but Lucr. illustrates what he means from what
goes on in our world, in haec rerum summa, as is natural3 for what
takes place throughout the universe is more or less a repetition of what
happens here: see 11. to 1 1008. '72 cuique is the [id] unde abeunt of
73, the illa of 74. '76 mutua is used as an adv. thus 5 or 6 times in
Lucr.: v 1100 we have mutua inter se, as here: Virgil uses per mutua:
Lepidus in Cic. ad fam. x 34 says, summa studia qffi'cii mutuo inter nos
certatim constiterunt pro nostra inter nos familiaritate. The sense is that
mortals receive life and in their turn give it to others, and so the chain
of being goes on: comp. 111 964 soll. '7 '7 Ov. met. xv 420 sic tempore
verti Cernimus atque illas adsumere robora 9entee, Concidere Ῐιαε. '7 9
the well-known metaphor of the torch-race: Varro de re rust. 111 16 9
nunc cursu lampada tibi t=rado3 the καθάπερ λαμπάδα τόν βίον παραδί-
δοντες os Plato.

80-1412 First-beginnings‚ when alone, move ceaselessly through
the infinite void by their own inherent motion or it may be after col-
1131011 with another: some of intricate shapes form after collision a close
union and thus help to compose hard bodies 3 others rebound to greater
distanceS, and form softer bodies 3 some do not unite at all, but continue
to wander through space: the motes in a sunbeam will gire some notion
of this: single atoms unite into small bodies, these small bodies form
themselves into somewhat larger ones 3 till by little and little they
become visible and are seen to move in the sun, though why they move
is not seen. 80 foll. atoma as we have seen, have weight as an inhe-
