eyesight of his readers. '759 veneno: Wak. and Lach. quote Varro

763—781: things too might just as well be their elements‚ since
things by turns come from them and pass into them: but if you say

order, those which made fire may now make air or anything else.—
It is possible enough that Lucr. viewing Heraclitus through the glosses
