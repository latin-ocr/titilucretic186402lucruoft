lent judge says ‘ne quis semidoctus putet reponendum eum constent3
illo enim modo pot-ius loquebantur antiqui’: the potius clearly goes too
far: yet Lucr. can use the indic. when, as here, you can translate ‘when
or while at the same time': comp. 11 690 Cum tamen . . neeesse est 5 and
see notes 1 to v1 130, which is essentially similar3 comp. too VI 140
cum tamen alta Arbusta . . haurit, where Lamb. again remarks ‘ cum
iunxit cum indicativo, quod M. Tullio et bonis scriptoribus usitatum est,
tametsi secus existimet vulgus': the tamen would seem to make a dis!
ference. possit reddi=possit ratio reddi, answering precisely to 572

dere multis with 111 258 quo pacto . . m'yeam rationem reddere and 1v 572
rationem reddere possis...quo pacto. 571 silices denotes the hard
blocks of volcanic basalt with which they paved their streets and roads:

menti‚ like percitus penetrari, apparet aperte and the like. In illustration
of 565-576 hear what Newton says in his optics p. 251 ‘all bodies
seem to be composed of hard particles: for otherwise fluids would not
congeal...Even the rays of light seem to be hard bodies...and therefore
hardness may be reckoned the property of all uncompounded matter... ·
Now if compound bodies are so very hard as we find some of them to be,

- and yet are very porous and consist of parts which are only laid together,

‚the simple particles which are void of pores and were never yet divided
must be much harder. For such hard particles being heaped together
can scarce touch one another in more than a few points, and therefore
must be separable by much less force than is requisite to break a solid
particle whose parts touch in all the space between them without any
pores or interstices to weaken their cohesion.'

577—598: again we do see things in being: they must have had
first-beginnings: could then these first-beginnings, if soft, have with-
¹stood the blows of infinite time? the persistency too of specific marks in
living creatures seems to prove an unchangeable matter at bottom.

582 Diserepat...potui38e: I know no other instance of this constr.: the
infin. clause probably is the subject to Dicor: comp. n. to 331. 586
foed. nat. a favourite expression: so 11 254 fati foedera 3 also foedere

379. 587 sancitum an almost unexampled form: the instances quoted
from Cicero seem all to be changed to sanctus in the latest editions.
588 quin constent: Lucr. with the older writers always thus uses quin
with a subj. when not followed by etiam or, as 11 799, ipso: see Lach.
