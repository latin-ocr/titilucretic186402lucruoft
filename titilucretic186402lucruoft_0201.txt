out of the atoms this world and other worlds; therefore these atoms
never could have thus combined, unless there was an infinite supply.
1021 for these three abls. 800 11. to 183. 1022 suo monosyl. here and
V 420: so 111 1025 sis oculis after Ennius: such a syniz. is rare in hex-
ameters3 most frequent in dramatic poetry. 1025 Eae inf i. e. tem-
pore: comp. V 188 and 423 and n. to 10013 and also Aen. 1x 63
collecta fatiyat edendi Ex Zonqo rabies. percita a favour-ite word in this
sense. 1026 Omne yenus: Lucr. is very fond of this idiom, common
in the best writers: quod yeuus also occurs often: an adj. omui-(Jerbas is
unknown to him; 800 n. to 683. motus and coetus are of course acc.
plur. 1027 disposituras: so V 192: see n. to 653: it appears to bc
peculiar to Lucr. 1028 partly recurs V 194. 1029 maynos annos:
V 644 Quae volvunt maynos iu mayrois mensibus annos. There is no
doubt an allusion, perhaps sarcastic, to the theories of the maynus annus.
He probably had 111 1118 mind some stoical interpretation of Heraclitus'
ecpyrosis, when our present system should end and a new cycle com-
mence. The poet then means to say, this world, though its term of
existence is nothing compared with the eternity of the universe, yet in
its present form outlives many of your great years, be they 19 or 19000
of our solar years. 1030 U t semel=postquam here and in the best
writers: see F orc. 1031 fluminis undis is the stream of water be-
longing to each amnis: see Foro. 8. v. and Aen. 11 305 rapidus montano
flumine torrens, which 110 also cites: IV 1036 Fluminis inqentis fluctus.
1033 summissa, if the word of Lucr. which is quite doubtful, must have
the special sense usual in the script. rei rust. brought up and kept for
breeding: 800 Forc. and Gesner s.v.: the meaning it has in 8 and 193
scarcely is in place here. 1034 vivant=durent by a poetical licence:
see n. to V 538: a stoic or peripatetic could here use it literally 3 but to the
philosopher Lucr. these things are rather an example, as he says V 125,
of what is vitali motu sensuque remotum. 1036 800 11. to 1000.
103'7 quaeque is accus. agreeing with amissa. in tempore: comp. 35 3 and
Ter. heaut. 364 In tempore acl eam veni. 1038 foll. comp. 11 1122
foll. 1039 am. cmx: so 810 amisso iam corpore 3 1V 535 Nec te fallit
item quid corporis auferat. 1041 aversa viai, a grecism to which I
know no exact parallel: Horace’s sceleris puruS, operum solutis are some-
what like: Enn. ann. 209 viai seems to depend not on fleaeere but quo.
1042 sum. omn. quaec. the whole of any sum of matter gathered toge-
ther, such as our summa or mundus here spoken of. 1044 cudere, an
expressive metaphor with playa or ictus, to give the force of Epicurus’
ἀντικοπή, the counter-stroke which makes the atom change its course and
enables it to combine. 1045 queatur: 111 1010 potestur: these or other
forms are common enough in the old writers ; as quitur quietas& nequitur
nequitum poteratur possitur. 1049 comp. 1036. 1050 E t tamen ε 1v
