Book 11 189

j of pain is the foundation of all pleasure3 and a very small positive addi-
.’ tion of pleasure will be all that is required. At the same time quemque,
the reading of Lamb. and others, is manifestly simpler: few things are
's needed, ut et omnem dolorem demant et voluptates quoque multas
dent. 22 substernere appears to have much the same force as the

simple sternere: the sub perhaps has the meaning it sometimes has in
j: subministrare and submittere, of a successive or continued supply.

23 ipsa seems to mean, nature for her part, as far as she is con-

, cerned, though habit and fashion may need something else. 24 foll.
after Odys. η 100 χρύσειοι δ’ ἄρα κοῦροι ἐυδμήτων ἐπὶ βωμῶν Ἔστασαν

τυμόνεσσινε 11 13 quite possible that these vss. of Homer may have
2- ⁴ suggested the fashion to wealthy Romans. 2¹7 fulqet: v 1049 sciret
” animoque is the only other instance of this licence in Lucr. which is ⁴
much more frequent in Virgil: there is no analogy between this prac-
j· tice and the lengthening of such syllables in Ennius: with him they
⁵ were really long, and in thesis as well as arsis, uter esset induperator
Ϊι and the like 3 where esset 13 as long as esses: in Lucr. and Virgil the
Ῠ” lengthening is a mere licence permitted in the arsis alone. 28 why
an editor should object to aurata in Lucr. because auro occurs in 27

’Ἰ Val. Flaccus 1116 Anthologia Livy Pliny Appuleius Prudentius: it is
specially recorded that Pollio did not gild the ceiling of the public

may refer to walls furniture and plate. The imitation of our passage

in the culex 61 foll. Si non Assyrio 661. has 62 si nitor auri Sub

general tone of these vss. is also imitated by Virg. geor. 11 461 Si

tamen refers to the Si non: nature wants no more, when they thus
