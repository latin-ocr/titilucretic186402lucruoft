379—468: in all this the eyes are not deceived 3 what they see,
they rightly see3 it is the mind that errs in the inferences it draws:
this applies to thousands of things in which the senses seem to be mis-
taken: when we are in a ship which is moving, it seems to be at rest,
and things which it passes to be in motion: the stars which are in per-
petual movement, appear to stand still: if you look down 6 long colon-
nade, the roof and floor and the sides seem 613 13116 0131161 end to converge
to 6 point: out at sea 13116 81111 appears 130 1186 from the water and to set
in it: the parts of a ship under water look bent and twisted upwards ε
when clouds scud across the sky, the stars seem to move 1116 0131161 way:
if you press the eyeball beneath, you see all things double: when fast
asleep 111 6 8111611 100111 111 13116 dark, you often think you see daylight and
are travelling over wide distances: in all this the error lies in the
opinions which the mind superinduees upon what the senses really per-
ceive. 383 diotimus in 368 foll. 385 naturam reram here = cau-

common constr. esse in motu: see n. to 1 999 (995). motu esse without
