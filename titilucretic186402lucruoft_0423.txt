tura haec: strict syntax would require horum, as Lamb. has written:
perhaps the turn of expression has been caused by 1085 Ut cava cet. :
such expressions as eae eo ‚qenere quae prosunt 3 ex >eo numero qui eonsules

both salutary and noxious, are ever flying about: sometimes the latter
are able to corrupt the air 3 1311611 0011168 pestilence, either in clouds and
vapours, or out of the corrupted earth: it is seen what effects change
of climate has on men, and how much climates differ, and how par-

the water we drink or the food we and other creatures eat, or make 118

1104 Temptari‚ a technical word for the attack of disease: comp. 1116
temptantur, 1137 temptare. 1105 disc. res: Η 1018 verum positura
