φωνίᾳ τήν ἀνωμαλίαν. 518 quaedam vid. velle, ruantque i. e. ut alia
videantur velle ruere, alia autem ruant, prodita et haec et illa cet.:
comp. 652 Esse minora iyitur quaedam maioraque debent. 520 iyitur
beginning an apodosis: see n. to 1 419. ratio cet. πᾶς γὰρ λόγος α’πό τῶν
αἰσθήσεων ἤρτηται, says Epic. in Diog. Laer. x 32.

522—‘548 : the way in which the other senses are acted upon, may
now be easily understood t sound is corporeal, since it is by striking on
the ear that it excites sensation ε often too the atoms of sound in pass-
ing through the narrow windpipe graze it and make it rough: again a
long speech spoken in a loud voice takes much strength and substance
from a man ι smoothness of sound comes from smoothness of its atoms,
roughness from roughness -in them. 522 quo pacto, ‘that is mani-
festly by impulse, the only way which we can conceive bodies operate
in’ says Locke essay 11 8 11: what follows has many points of singular
agreement with what Lucr. says here and in parts of 11. 523 scru-
posa: the metaphor is obviem, though the word does not appear to
occur elsewhere in this sense 3 and the form scrupeus has also this mean-
ing, but only in late writerS. 524 auditur cet.: so Epic. in Diog.
Laer. X 52 τὸ οἷκούειν γίνεται ῥεύματός τινος φερομένου οἶπό τοῦ φωνοῦντος
ἢ η’χοῦντοςῆ ψοφοῦντος ἢ ὅπως δήποτ’ ἀκουστικὸν πάθος παρασκευάζοντος.
τὰ δὲ ῥεῦμα τοῦτο εἰς ὁμοιομερεῖς ὄγκους διασπείρεται κ.τ.λ. 525 pepu-
lere. . sensum: Cic. de nat. deor. 11 144 priusquam seusus ab his [vocibus]
pulsus esset. 529 arteria: this neut. form appears to occur only here.
asperiora, perhaps with reference to its technical name the aspera aa·-
teria, τραχεῖα οἷρτηρίαε see Cicero and Celsus in Forc. 532 quoque
belongs equally to the three words expleti ianua oris 3 as in Illud in Itis
quoque te rebus, quoque belongs equally to the whole phrase illud iu Itis
rebus 3 for the meaning is os quoque expletur et eius ianua raditum ex-
pleti, VI 1203 sanquis expletis mribus ibat: the word in these two places
has doubtless its usual meaning, though Lach. says the sense which
Donatus and Ennius give it of exinanitus would be appropriate here.
545 sub murmure: comp. 785 Omnia sub verbone creat natura, and n.
there-z the force of sub seems to be similar in Hor. od. 111 7 30 Sub
cantu querulae despice tibiae, and Celsus v 26 31 sub friyido sudore
moriuntur. muyit: Aen. vm 526 Tyrrhenusque tubae muyire . . clanqor.
546 cita i. e. sonitu ε 608 sonituque cientur [loca]. 547 whoever has
travelled over Helicon and seen and heard its rushing torrents, will feel
the fitness of making them the haunts of swans; and he who has not
visited the place, might well believe that they would come to sing their
dirge after having, in the words of Helicon's own poet, λοεσσάμενοι
τέρενα χρόα Περμησσοῖο *H ἵππου κρήνης ἢ “Ολμειοῦ ζαθέοιο.

549—594: as the sounds are coming out, the tongue forms them
into articulate words 3 every one of which is distinctly heard near at
