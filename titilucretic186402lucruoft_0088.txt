70 No'rEs 1

J unt. as Ald. 1 has avidam. 227 restet transire Lactant. and Nic. N icc.
for re et transirest, that curiously frequent blunder of AB: see Iv. 783.
239 eodem omnis Gis. rightly for eadem omnis, and before him the Paris
ed. of Pius, tota eadem Lamb. 241 nativo ac mortalibus Lach. for
nativom mortalibus: not Naugerius who has nativo mortalibus. nativo
et mortalibus Avanc. in notes at end of his Catullus, and vulg. 245 item
Bentl. for idem.

248 Me milii B most rightly. Memini A. Memmi vulg: hence
Lamb. me arripuisse for corripuisse 111 247. Wak. not fearing the sole-
cism, finds fault with previous editors, and reads corripuisse and Memmi.
251 non nulla Nic. N icc. camb. Ver. Ven. for non ulla. 257 alid

Lamb. ed. 1 and 2 for alit right-ly: ed. 3 116 restores alit. 258 Redditur.
Boditur J unt. Lamb. vulgo before Wak.

282 recenti B corr. Flor. 3] Oamb. for reqenti. 291 Et Ald. 1 J unt.
for Ut. 295 lycliini Ed. for lyclini. lychni A corr. Nic. N icc. Macrob.
Lucr. seems to have known only the trisyllabic form, whether he wrote
lychini or lucltini or licliini,· or even one of the still older forms lucini
or licini. Ritschl in Rhein. Mus. n. f. x. p. 447 —451 shews that Enn.
ann. 328 wrote lucinorum lumina bis seoe,· Lucilius lucinosque or luchi-
nosque: so dracuma, mina (μνᾶ), tecina (τέχνη), cucinus 01 cicinus
(κύκνος), and other like forms all arising from the dislike of the old
Latius to certain combinatione of consonante: comp. Aesculapius Alcu-
mena Hercules and many such like. Lucr. or his editor may have writ-
ten y, as it was introduced for Greek words just before his death: the
aspirated ch was in common use some 40 years earlier, as Ritschl proves.
296 caliyine. fuliyine Bentl. and Wak. from a sheer misunderstanding
of Lucr. 297 properant Ald. l J unt. for proferant. 301 celeri celatur
Madvig and Lach. for celeri celeratur. toleratur Nic. N icc. Ver. Ven.
vulg. 302 putandumst Lach. for putandum: see 1 111.

312 Aeraque proporro solidumque senescere ferrum Ed. for Quaerere
proporro sibicumque senescere credas: see Camb. J curn. of phil. 1 p. 373
and 1v p. 142. Aeraque and solidumque are simple enough corrections.
credas in this, the 12th line from the end of p. 204 of the archetype, has
come from credis, in the thh line from the end of p. 205, and has sup-
planted Lucretius' word ferrum. All older corrections of this verse are
strangely improbable: Quae fore proporro vetitumque senescere credas
Lach. Cedere proporro subitoque senescere casu J unt. Lamb. ed. 1 and 2
0166011. Lamb. ed. 3 obelises this and adds the ms. verse. Is. Voss. (not
Abr. Preiger) in ms. notes has Quae ruere proporro ibi conque senescere
credas. [Quare proporro sibi cumque senescere credas] Β6111. Gis. and
Wak. find no difficulty in the ms. reading. 318 omnem J unt. for omne.
319 si om. Nic. Nico. and all later mss: hence much confusion in eds,
before Lach. Havercamp not deigning to record that AB both had si.
omne . . terrai Avanc. terram, quod J unt. vulg. 331 N aturast mundi
Ald. l, Natura est J unt. for Natura mundist: this common blunder of
our mss. Wak. here keeps. 339 periisse Flor. 31 for perisse. 342 atque
oppida Flor. 31 Oamb. for at oppida. ac Nic. N icc. 2 Vat. Brix. Ver.
Ven. Wak. 349 isdem Pius in notes, Lamb. for idem which Lach.
keeps: see 11 693. Lach. was the first to join inter nos with what
follows.
