soles for dies occurs in Virgil and others. 1222 fida eanum vis: see
n. to 1v 681 permissa canum vie. 1225 see notes to 1247—1251.
vasta must have its first sense of vacua, deserta, therefore almost the
same as Incomitata. 1227 ali : see n. to 1v 637. 1228 Volvere has
much the same force as in Virg. geor. 111 85 volvit sub naribus iynem,
quoted by Wak. licere is used as an accus. subst. : see n. to 1 418: but
here it has a second infin. depending on it, Volvere and tueri: dederat ut
liceret volvere. eae. tem. tu.: Aen. 1v 451 taedet caeli convexa tueri.
1229 comp. Virgil geor. 111 511 Moae erat hoc ipsum exitio. 1230
foll. in all this part he is closely following Thuc. : Ι do not commence a
new paragraph, as the corresponding sentence in Thuc. could not well
begin one. 1232 morti damn: a very rare constr.: damnari in metal-
lum, in opus publicum, acl bestias are legal terms, for which Appul. met.
X p. 748 has bestiis esset damnatam 3 and Stat. Theb. V1 55 has Damna-
tus flammae torus: in the following passages of Lucan is the subst. in

ut si, quasi, tamquam esset, though it is a. very rare use: Lach. quotes
Val. Flaccus v 92 fulsere undae, sol maqnus ut orbem Tolleret aut
nubem quateret potue. 1234 an. am.: auctor ad Herenn. lv 57 amisit
vitam, at non perdidit...ami3it animam, potitus est qloriam. respectam,
as v 975 taciti respectabant. 1235 Quippe etenim cet.: what is the
meaning of these conjunctionsl the poet has just been saying that the
most piteous thing of all was to see how those who caught the disease‘
at once lost heart, gave themselves over, and made no effort for life : he
then goes on to say ‘for they at no time ceased to catch the infection’
and so on. Why this for? how 8311 the fear or danger of infection add
to the grief and despair ofthose who are already strickenl both in these
vss. and 111 what precedes and follows the poet is treading closely on the
steps of the historiam? now read the words he is here trans-lating: 51 6
