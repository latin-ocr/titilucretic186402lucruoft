408—443: also what is pleasing or offensive to the other senses,
to the hearing smell sight, must be formed of elements more or less
smooth or rough respectively: again some bitter flavours have elements,
not hooked, but slightly prominent: those of fire and cold are jagged,
but in different ways as shewn by touch, which is the body’s sense,
whether it is affected pleasantly or unpleasantly, from within or from
without. , 408 Omnia postr. passing from taste to the other 8611868.
tactu 18 11616 the dat. of tactus 3 and is quite synon. with sensibus, as it
implies in its general meaning every way in which you can tanyere
et tanyi τ thus tanyere 1 643 18 said of hearing, 11 403 of taste‚ 1V 674 of
smell. Virgil ends geor. 111 416 with aut mala tactu: but tactu there
appears to be the supine. 412 musaea : this adj. appears peculiar to
Lucr. at least in the senses in which he employs it: here it = musica 3 in
1 and IV it = simply musarum. mele: 505 cycnea mele; V 334 modo
orqanici melicos peperere sonores. This v. is almost made up of Greek
words. 413 fiqurant: IV 552 Formaturaque labrorum pro parte fiqu-
rat, 1.6. 81161168 the articulate words: here I presume putting the tunes
into shape means to execnte them. 416 Et cum and 420 Et qui:

referam) pavisse oculos spectata inimici morte iactavit : comp 1 36. 421
it is not easy to see how mere ugliness or hideousness of aspect implies
roughness in the atoms: one could conceive a very ugly thing having a
soothing effect, if applied to the eyes3 while bright and beautiful objects
may often conpunyere aciem. 423 principiali lev. 1.6. levore princi-

piorum: comp. 425 materiae squalore. 426 quae iam nec: the force ’

of iam is clear enough3 which, when you come to them, you can no
longer call either smooth etc: comp. Cic. de fin. v 14 praetereo multos,
in Itis . . Hieronymum, quem iam cur Peripateticum appellem nescio:
it cannot have the meaning it has just after in 430, 431, 440, where
particular instances 616 specified. 429 Titillare . . sensus: Cic. de nat.
deor. 1 113 lias leviores olicis voluptates quibus quasi titillatio (Epicuri

esset quac quasi titillaret sensus 3 and other passages: Epicurus' own
word γαργαλίζειν 18 often mentioned: 116 applied it to the slighter bodily

pleasures. 430 Faecula: Hor. sat. 11 8 9 faecula Coa: the secula of

century it became common to put 6 for ae in many words, maereo aerumna
paenitet cet. 433 tactus uterque = tactus utriusque : Hor. od. 11 17 8
