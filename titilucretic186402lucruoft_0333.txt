their mistress. 11¹7 9 foribus cet.: Aen. 11 490 Amplexaeque tenent
postes atque oscula fiyunt. 1180 venientem follows on the iam amm„
coming after leave given 3 exactly as 1177 lacrimans eoeclusus is weep-
ing because shut out: a copula instead of being necessary, would be
very awkward. 1181 modo· : see n. to 11 1135. 1182 cadat: Wak.
compares Virg. geor. 111 138 Rursus cura patrum cadere 3 but there the
force of the word is not very clear: see Conington: cadat is perhaps
like 11 1175 incassum cecidisse: see Foro. 1183 Stultitiae: ‘dam-
natur aliquis crimine vel iudicio, sed sceleris parricidii furti iniuriae.
in Oiri 188 quod habent exemplaria tanto scelere damnare puellam
neque modulatum est neque Latinum’ Lach. 1186 poscaenia: the
Latins often said pos or po before many consonants, pos tempus posquam
pomeridianus and the like: Ribbeck I see repeatedly introduces such
forms into Virgil: see notes 1 to 1252.

1192—1208: yet women sometimes feel true love in return. 1195
facit ex animo: Ter. Andr. 794 ex animo omnia, U t fert natura, facias
an de industria. 1196 spat. dec. am.: 111 1042 decurso lumine vitae 3
Ov. trist. 111 4 33 pede inoffenso spatium decurrere vitae. 1199 illo-
rum neut. may mean the femaleS, according to Lucretius’ usual practice
when the reference is to different genders volucres armenta cet. subat
in good writers seems always to be said of the female in heat. 1205
Quom interea seems a harsh elision3 and none other like it is found
in Lucr. 3 for 11 850 Quoad licet is a synizesis. Virg. ecl. 111 48 Si ad
vitulam, and this eclogue appears to be one of his earliest: in Catul-
lus such elisions are frequent: LXIV 305 he has Cum interea, as Lucr.
here: IV 809 contendere se atque parare, the elision seems to have a
similar effect. val. Ven. com. : 1148 validos Veneris perrumpere nodos.
1207 iac. infr. : 817 nos in fraudem induimus.

1209—1232 : according as the seed of the man or woman prevails at
conception, the child is more like to the one or to the other 3 and this is
so whether the child be male or female. 1209 comm. cet. i. e. comm.
semine suo virili semine. 1210 vim vicit vi: in a very similar pas-
sage of Hippocr. de genit. 7 ἐκρατέετο is used in the same way: comp.
too Plut. de plac. phil. v 11 where it is given as a stoical doctrine, κᾶν

theory to Anaxagoras: Anaxayoras autem eius parentis faciem referre
liberos iudicavit, qui seminis amplius contulisset. Epicurus may have
got this as many other things from him 3 but Hippocrates, whom Lucr.
had evidently studied, de genit. 7 and 8 teaches precisely the same:
