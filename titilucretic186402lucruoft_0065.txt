BOOK 11 47

deinde aliud est auctus re aliqua, aliud factae de re aut ex re aliqua.
hoc qui nescit, fateatur se hospitem esse in lingua Latina': this he doubt-
less intended for Gifanius. Wak. more seat-less than the angels keeps of
course auctum and thus comments, ‘editores aptam [most factum] ausi
scilicet, libris omnibus religionem invocantibus contra profanos emenda-
tores, dictionem Lucretio lubentissime frequentatam contextu emovere, ,
et fetus proprios per audaciam odiosissimam atque perditissimam infercire.
ὥς ἀργαλέον πρᾶγμ’ ἐστίν, ὦ Ζεῦ καὶ θεοί.’ Truly delira llaec ficriosaque

who has a full stop at ollis. Ald. 1 J unt. vulg. have ut for ita in 1003:
as no editor before Wak. would tolerate the omission of ut .· yet it is
a strange thing that our mss. so often omit ut after efficere and fieri, if
the omission is not the poet's own. 1010—1012 Lach. and Bern. with
all previous editors have quite misunderstood this passage in which not
a letter is to be changed : they all take quod to be the conjunction 3 it
is really the relative. Lach. for summis unskilfully reads cunctis, and
supposes 1013 to commence a new paragraph wholly unconnected with
what precedes: he encloses in [ ] 1013—1104. The truth is 1013-
1022 are closely united with what precedes if rightly understood. J unt.
Lamb. ed. 1 vulg. have parum for penes in 1010. Lamb. ed. 3 has a
long note shewing that his conception of the passage is no less con-
fused than Lachmann’s. The small word quod has given rise to these
strange misapprehensionS. 1015 1016 = 1 820 821 with the exception
of Siynfficant for Constituunt .· 1020 = '726 and v 438 (441). Lach. has
rightly seen that they are here quite out of place : in the first book they
are properly said of the atoms, but here they interrupt the sense. 1020
the interpolator has transferred hither without taking the trouble of
changing vias and plaqas to viae and playae, which is first done in
Ald. 1 and J unt. 1017 sunt Lach. for sint: he compares 458.

1023 adhibe veram Β corr. Ver. Ven. for adhibueram. 1024 vemen-
ter Avanc. and Lach. rightly for vehementer: so vemens which occur-s
several times z in fact those were the only forms known to Lucr. and all
writers of the best ages: see Lach. 1025 Accedere all mss. and old eds. :
this old form Ι have retained here and v 609 where A has Accedere,
Nic. Nicc. Accendere .· see Vahlen's Varron. sat. Menipp. p. 95, and his
Ennian. trag. rel. 114 and 281, where the best mss of Ennius and
Varro retain the same form accedo .· it appears from Ribbeck that the
mSS. of Virgil preserve in many similar words esor i, but his judgment
in adopting them seems often at fault. peremo interemo neyleyo intelleyo
were the only forms admitted in the best ageS, as the concurrent testi-
mony of all good mss. proves. 1029 minuant mirarier. ‘mittant mira-
rier Lach. which I adopted in the small ed. 1030 ›Suspicito Bern. for
Principio. Percipito Lach. which can hardly be right: indeed Principio
is so appropriate that I incline to think a verse is lost, such as this
Cuius, uti memoro, permulta exempla videmus .· Principio ‘chief of all!
Lamb. in 1029 has Principio quod raon m. m. o. Paulatim, caeli cet.
