INTRODUCTION ‘105

them much more frequently than quadrupedantum eqredientem and the
like: Catullus luxuriates in movements like these Nereides admirantes,
ae moenia Larisaea, fluetus salis adimebant, and Virgil and Ovid both
affect such terminatione, to a line as Iovis incrementum, Phryqia aymina
circumspexit,· but more in Greek than in Latin' words. This however
is no 'eoncession to ancient practice, but a mere modern prettiness intro-
duced by the school of Alexandrine imitators mentioned above: see

σπονδειάζοντες 111 1113 last book‘l Other forms of spondaic endings, bor-
rowed from the Greek and mostly applied to Greek words, are common
in Catullus Virgil and Ovid. They need not be mentioned here, as they
generally carry with them an air of affectation, quite alien to the nature
of Lucretius. He never puts more than two spondees together at the
end of the line, while the other three do not reject such rhythms as
Nereidum matri et Neptuno Aeyaeo after the manner of the Greeks.
Lucretius does not avoid sometimes very harsh and prosaic endings such
as constare: id ita esse. When Virgil 1133 30011 terminations of a verse as
procumbit humi bos, it is done for effect 3 Lucretius employs them some-
times for a purpose, oftener without any. He is especially fond of
elisions atter the fourth foot like these, perdelirum esse videtur, permu-
tato ordine solo, minu-s· oblato aeriter ictu, nisi concilio ante coacto: in
elisions generally he is sometimes less, sometimes more violent than
Virgil. One other point is worth noticing: Lucretius loves to have the
fourth foot wholly contained in one word and ending with that word: in
the first 43 verses 01 his poem, a highly elaborated passage, more than
half the number have movements like these, quae terras fruyfferentis,
not terras quae ,· exortum lumina solis, tibi suavis daedala tellus,
not suavis tibi,· tibi rident aequora ponti, diffuso lumine eaelum, yeni-
tabilis aura favoni and so 011. Τ1113 produces a grand and stately, but
somewhat monotonous effect. Catullus however carries it. as far or
even farther than Lucretius. Virgil, though he often uses this flow and
with much effect, avoids it as a rule: he says Troiae qui primus, not
qui Troiae ; labentem eaelo quae ducitis annum, not quae eaelo, as Lu-
cretius would have done. It must not be questioned that in the con-
struction of single verses and still more in the rhythmica] movement
which he impresses on a whole passage Lucretius is a far less careful
and skilled artist than Virgil. The effect which his grandest passages
produce is owing more to the vigour and originality of the thought
and the force and freshness of the expression than to studied polish
and elaboration. Yet for all that he is perhaps as a writer of Latin
heroic verse to be placed next to Virgil: Catullus in his hexameters
