may suit poetry, but is unfit for natural science: 11 465 Sudor uti

the rocks could not yield at 6113 the other parts being more or less
dense would sink more or less.

495—508: thus the earth sank to the bottom, and sea air ether
were left separate, ether above all, which glides on its even way and
mixes with none of 13116 lower elements. 499 liquidis: all were
pure compared with the earth, though not relatively to ether. 500

templum 3 though in the next passage he leaves 113 611 open question, as
one beyond the reach of our experience and certain knowledge: 510

509—533: the stans may move from various causes: if the whole
heaven revolves, then must we say that, while 611 air presses on each
pole and keeps it in its place, the heaven revolves with its stars by a
third air which either blows 011 113 above in the direction in which it and
1136 stars are going, or beneath in an opposite direction 3 60 1311613 13116
6711016 sphere is thus kept in motion like 6 waterwheel: if the heaven
does not move, then may the stars move because they have in them fires
of ether trying to escape and thus driving them on 3 or an air blowing
from some quarter may impel them3 or they may move of themselves
whither their food invites them: it cannot be told for certain how this
goes on in our world 3 but in the countless existing worlds every one of
these causes is in operation—3 and one must act in this our world3 but
it is rash to assert that any one must be the sole cause.-— This passage
too as Lach. has proved stands in no connexion with what precedes and
follows: 534 should at once follow 508 3 and at 774 116 makes no allu-
sion whatever to this paragraph: clearly then it is 611 after addition of
the poet’s who had observed that he had entirely omitted this question
