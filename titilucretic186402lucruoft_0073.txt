amusing. Wak. returns to et fine. '734 contaqe. contaqibas Lach.
'736 Cwm subeant is quite right. Quod s. a friend of Faber' s, both
Faber and Bentl.app1·0ving.⁰Cui s. Bern. qna Ald. 1 J unt for que.
'738 quidum Bern. acutely for ut quicum: the origin of the corruption is
plain. Lach. adopts from Lamb. nt iam, which he allows ‘a litteris ni·
mium recedere.' '740 consensus Lach. for consensu.

'743 rightly rejected by Lach. and before him by a ‘ doctus quidam’
ap. Lamb. as a manifest sarcastic gloss, which interrupts sense and con-
struction: Ven. Ald. 1, not Junt„ read cervis for cervos. Lamb. dolu’
vulpibus also. '74¹7 toto Β, quoqne A and all other mss. and old eds. ‘toto
praetuli, quia non possum ullam artem agnoscere in simili hoc trium
versiculorum exitu, inqenioque, seminioque, corpore qnoque. non potest
autem dubitari quin utraque scriptura fuerit in archetypo' Lach. Lamb.
also has toto; authority is clearly for quoque. '760 sin Ald. 1 J unt. for
sic. '763 :7462 of course a gloss, with no connexion with the text.
Bern. includes '764 in the gloss, in my opinion not rightly.

¹784 in alto. salso Lach. because salso is found in the repetition of
this passage v 128. But as Lucr. like virgil, so often varies in such
points, I cannot bring myself to depart from the mss. '789 lonyiter
Lamb. Lach. lonyius all 11188. 11616 and v 133: comp. 6¹76. '790—793
are repeated v 134-——13'7 without the mss. differing in a single letter.
I flatter myself I have made the passage clear by a correct punctuation
without the change of a word: ¹790 posset enim multo prius I enclose in
brackets, and begin the apodosis at soleret. Lach. here and in V reads Quid
si posset enim 2 oriulto. Ald. 1 J unt.vulg. give Hoc si posset enim, multo.
800 mortale J unt. for mortalem. 805 saevas J unt. for salvas. 806-——818
= v 351—363 word for word. They here interrupt the argument, and
are of course one of the many 8108868 with which some reader has wished
either to explain or refute the poet by quoting his own verses for or
against him, as the case may be. But as that which follows in the fifth
book, applies only to the heaven, not to the mind of which Lucr. is here
speaking, he did not continue his quotation 3 but Ald. 1 and J unt. fol-
lowed by all editors before Lach. add v 364-373, rudely altered to suit
the present subject. This was probably done by Marullus. ‘at Michahel
Marullus' says Lach. justly indignant ‘illo [lectore] audacior nihil veritus
