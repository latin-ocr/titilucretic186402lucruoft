Inter niqra virwn percocto saecla colore. 1111 Quat. a ventis ε Virg.
geor. 1v 298 Quattuor a ventis : the usual force of a ventis is 011 the side
exposed to the wind3 here a ventis, partibus are rather used, as a
fronte, a teryo : Livy XXVII 48 15 ica ex omnibus partibus, ab fronte, ab
latere, ab teryo trucidantur: it means therefore in the regions where
these winds and quarters of heaven are. 1114 Seren. Samon. 133
Est clephas morbus tristi quoque nomine dirus. elephas or elephantiasis,

geor. 11 94 Temptatu‘ra pedes and Sen. epist. 83 at end temptantur pedes
are said of the reeling of drunkenness. 1119 quod—Commovet must

1161 coactans: a Lucretian word. 1126 ipsas seems only to dis-
tinguish fruyes from aqua-33 at all events aquas and fi·u968 seem to be
exactly coordinate, and the one to have no preeminence over the other.
1127 hom. pastus pcc. cibatus: pecudum pastus hominumque cibatus
