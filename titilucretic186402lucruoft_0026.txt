3 NOTEs 1

by Avancius or Candidus: VI 650-652 are quite correctly ,given by
Avancius, and in his learned preface 116 says with reference to 652 Nec
tota pars cet. ‘ totus prima brevi, quia quoti redditivus est.’ Crinitus 1.].
xv 4 quotes 650 651 rightly, and adds ‘qua in re grammaticorum nobis
authoritas patrocinatur, quando et centesimus et millesimus probe dici-
tur: partem multesimam inquit Nonius nove positum est a Lucretio
pro minima, ne quis forte paulo incautius atque audacius a veteribus
decedat. quae a me vel ob eam rationem sunt adnotata, quoniam Marul—
lus Bizantius aetate nostra, vir alioqui diligens, paulo improbius delere
haec et alia pro ingenio subdere tentavit, quae ab eius quoque sectatori-
bus recepta sunt pro verissimis'. Candidus gives these two verses rightly
and says in note at end of J unt. ‘ citatur Nonio locus’: he has got this
clearly from Crinitus, who in the same chapter correctly quotes and
illustrates 1 640 Quamde yravis cet. which the Italian mss. and editions
had corrupted: this too Candidus took from him 3 for Marullus appears
to have read Quam yravior Graios inter as does Pius in his notes, and
Gryphius of Lyons. Again VI 332 Avancius rightly gives per rara
viarum, Candidus perversely aster Marullus per operta: see his note.
But fifty instances like the last might be quoted. Candidus has also
missed some of the best of Marullus' conjectures: see for instance notes
1 to 1 1013 where I have got from the margin of one of the Florentine
mss. perhaps the most brilliant example of his critical acumen. Then
again unless Ι greatly err Ι have shewn in my notes that Gifanius in
preparing his edition had before him a copy of the Venice ed. of 1495,
lent to him by the zealous scholar Sambumw, as he testifies both in his
preface to Sambucus and in his address to the reader. In the former he
says ‘ exemplum Lucretii ad nos dedisti, non illud quidem calamo exara-
tum, sedita vetustum et idoneum, ut vicem optimi manuscripti fuerit,
siquidem in eo vidi omnium paene mendorum origines, quae magnam
partem a Michaele Marullo, cuius immutationes in eo adscriptae erant
omnes, primum parta, mox admiserunt Florentini cet.’: in the address
he speaks of the ‘ Sambuci liber quem ipsius Marulli manu adnotatum,
magno pretio vir ille praestantissimus paravit'. Why then Lachmann
p. 6 should write ‘ neque enim facile Gifanio credere possum Marulli
ipsius manu annotatum fuisse illud exemplar impressum quod se ab
Iohanne Sambuco utendum accepisse scribit' Ι cannot comprehend.
Grifanius was a dishonest plagiary, but at the same time a most astute
man. Why should 116 tell a gratuitous falsehood which Sambucus
would at once detectl He was writing only two generations after
Marullus’ death 3 and even if Sambucus gave his money for what was
not the handwriting of Marullus, it was at least a genuine copy of his
notes. But notes 1 furnish abundant proof of what Ι say: see for in-
stance those to 1 806 11 9 v 44 and especially 111 944: I could give
fifty other examples, is it were necessary. It appears then that Avan-
cius got from Marullus much which the J untine does not record, and
on the other hand that Candidus took from Avancius without acknow-
ledgment much that Lachmann and others assign to Marullus. Gandi-

dus, as I have said above, formed his text on a copy of the first Aldine: ,

in doing this he must have had before him another edition with the
ms, notes of Marullus, perhaps the very one which he tells us was
