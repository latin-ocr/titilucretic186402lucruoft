character given him by Catullus 111 1113 loth and 28th poems, which form
a curious comment 011 the ‘ worth and sweet friendship ’ which Lucr.
found in him, deceived, as men of his temperament so often are, by the
specious qualities of a worldly man, But 116 was already dead when
Memmius so fiagrantly disgiaced himself in the matter of the consulship,
and went into exile, abandoned by Caesar to whose party 116 had impu-
dently gone over. His country found that ‘ the general weal ’ could
easily enough dispense with his services. His contempt for Latin letters
which Cicero mentions would also seem to fit him but little for patron to
so genuine a Latin poet. Did Lucr. address Memmius as a believer in
Epicurus? or did he rather seek to convert him to that creedl If so,
his teaching was sadly thrown away: he called 011 Memmius to look on
Epicurus as a god: it appears from a curicus letter, ad fam. XIII l,
written from Athens by Cicero to Memmius who had just gone 130 Myti-
lene, that the latter had obtained from the Areopagus a piece of ground
on which stood some ruins of Epicurus’ house, and that he wished to pull
these down 111 order to build for himself. Though he had now aban·
doned the design of building, he churlishly refused to give up the pro-
perty to Patre, at that time head of the school. Patro and his sect
looked on these ruins as a holy place 3 and Cicero out of love for him and
his predecessor Phaedrus and above all Atticus, begs Memmius, as the
ground is now of no use to him, to let them have it. All through the
letter he expresses himself, and assumes that Memmius feeIs, the greatest
contempt for epicurean tenets 3 but he says he loves Atticus as a brother,
‘non quo sit [Atticus] ex istis [epicureis]3 est enim omni liberali doc-
trina politissimus 3 sed valde diligit Patronem, valde Phaedrum amavit'.
And surely Lucr. too had exceedingly esteemed Patro, exceedingly loved
Phaedrus: I d cinerem aut manis credis curare sepultos.

Most readers of this opening address, like the one who of old pls-ced
in the margin of the ms. the six lines from the 2nd book, must have
been struck by its curicus contrast with the poet’s philosophical prin-
ciples. Bayle in his article on Lucr. 11. Ι says it 13 most reasonable to
call it a ‘jeu d'esprit’. Lucr. seeing that all poets invoked the muses at
the beginning of a great work, did not wish to be without a like orna-
ment and chose Venus as the divinity most suitable to a natural philoso-
pher: in the same way he invokes Calliope VI 94. There is some plausi-
bility 111 131113; Calliope we at once feel to be an ordinary personification
of the epic muse 3 and had Lucretius' address to Venus had 110 more
depth of feeling in it than that to Calliope, or other poets' invocations
of the museS, we should have accepted her as a simple impersonation of
the active energy of nature. But the intense earnestness of the language,·.
the words plain and simple in themselveS, yet instinct with life and¹
passion, make us feel that there is more than this. If the poet began
