that Praeterea in 342 cannot be right x it draws the conclusion from all
the instances given above beginning with 3423 and it would be ludi-
crous to include what precedes, that is, to assert ‘therefore it follows
that atoms must have different shapes, because I have declared that they
must not all have the same shapes.' 380 quaedam here does not sully
express the author's meaning: it appears to be an intentional under-
statement, to serve for the moment : he soon afterwards proves that the
shapes, though not infinite, are very very many.

381—39'7 ε thus the fire of lightning can pass where earthly fire
cannot, because it is formed of finer atoms : for like reasons light passes
through horn, rain does not3 wine runs easily, oil slowly through a
strainer, because the elements of oil are larger or more hooked, and so
cannot separate so readily. 383 suat recurs IV 637 and is found in
Virgil. 385 maqis may belong to Suptilem 3 but it seems better to'
take it with parvis: comp. vi 225 Hunc tibi subtilem cum primis iqui-

are here the atoms themselves 3 as 679 varias cohibere fiquras 3 also 682,
685, 817, 111 190, 246, vl 770, 776 : see n. to 1 55 foll. ε so Democritus
gave the name of ἰδέαι or εἴδη, which Aristotle translates by σχήματα,
sometimes to the shapes of atoms, sometimes to the atoms themselves.

398—407 : honey and milk are pleasant to the taste, wormwood and
the like nauseous 3 the former therefore consist of smooth, the latter of
jagged atoms which tear a way into the body. 401 Centauri : lv 125
and Virg. geor. IV 270 have the form centaurea3 the mss of Pliny who
often uses the word appear to give centaurion or centaurium for the
nomin. ε the latter is the form used here : it appears not to be found in
Greek. absinthi, Aeqi, coowliyli are similar genitives of Greek words.
401 pertorquent appears not to be found elsewhere: the nomin. is
natura twice repeated: this is less harsh than 111 558. Virg. geor. 11
