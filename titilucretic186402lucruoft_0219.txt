'BOOK 11 201

κλητον τήν κακίαν, says Plut. de repug. stoic. 34, p. 1050 G. 262 ri-
9antur, spread over the body like so many rivi: comp. 1v 907 somnus
per membra quietem Inriyet with Furius in Macr. sat. VI 1 44 mitemque
riqat per pectora somnum. 263 Nonne vides cet. has suggested his
simile to Virgil geor. 111 103 Nonne vides, cum...ruuntque effusi carcere
currus cet. tempore puncto, a favourite phrase of his: vl 230 puncto in
tempore, with his usual fondness for in with the abl. of time: it=puncto
temporis, while the smallest point of time is pricked down or marked.
264 Carceribus had their name from being prison-like vaults with gates
in front, from which the chariots started: just as the oppidum above
them had its name from resembling a fortified town. 265 de subito re-
curs 111 643: 800 Foro. 267 conquiri i. e. be sought out and brought
into communication one part with the other. 269 corde the seat of
the animus. 2¹70 icl seems to refer 130 13110 preceding v.: creatum hunc
initum motus 3 1311011 perhaps motum alone is 13110 subject of dari. 271
Inde . . porro: Wak. compares Aen. V 600 hinc maxima porro Accepit
Roma: 1 461 porro deinde seems different 3 see n. there. totum corpus
et wrtus: he has many such pleonasms 3 though this might be explained
through the body generally and each of its parts: so per membra per
artus and the like: 1v 887 quae in corpore toto Per membra atque artus
animai dissita vis est3 1042 Per membra atque artus decedit corpore
toto: vl 797 membra per artus Solvunt 3 945 per omnia membra, per
artus. 2¹72 similest ut cum seems like similis ut si qui, tamquam si,
which occur in Cicero. ictu depends on impulsi. 285 foll.: 800 Cio.
de fato quoted at 251: the passage tallies exactly with this3 pondus
and playa denote 1311010, as here, the natural and the impressed motion of
atomS. 288 foll.: Lucr. too, like Cicero l.l., assigns the freedom of
the will as the chief proof of the necessity of this third motion: the
natural gravity of atoms gives them says Lucr. a certain independence
and power of resisting extraneous force 3 but the mind itself can only
escape from inexorable necessity and acquire freedom of action by this
fitful declination of atoms. 289 necessum est is used several times by
Lucr. as well as by Plautus and Livy: see Fore: but Lach. to vl 815
justly observes that necessum used as it is here with an epithet is singular
enough. 291 ferri patique: v 314 perferre patique, which Horace
uses more than once, and Martial VH 39 3 3 Terence has perferre ac
pati, Cicero patietur perferet and the like. 292 clinamen: see n. to 1
435 and 653: it=declinatio or inclinatio.

This theory has naturally enough drawn down on Epicurus the
scoffs of his many adversaries: res tota ficta pueriliter, says Cicero: the
whole business is contradiction and ridiculous nonsense, echoes Bentley
in his Boyle 1001311108. Even his friends have mostly here deserted him.
Yet there is something grand and poetioal in its very simplicity. He
