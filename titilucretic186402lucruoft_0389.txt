the instruments employed in it: men first practised it, afterwards
women, 1350 Nexilis vestis would be a garment of skins fastened
on the body by tying. 1353 Insilia might be supposed to be con-
nected with insilio and to answer to the treadle, pressed by the weaver’s
foot: but Oreech pertinently remarks that levia is not then an appro-
pria-te epithet: and iron or 813661 could hardly be needed for such a pur-
pose: Schneider in his index to the script. rei. rust. thinks they are the
heddles or leash-rods which open the warp, as Rich records 3 and this is
probable enough. The word is not found elsewhere and its meaning
must be guessed. radii seem to have performed 13116 office both os

durum, 1360 in duro durarent: 1402 Duriter et duro.

1361-1378: nature first taught to sow plant graft: then one kind
of culture after another was discovered, and more and more ground
brought under tillage. 1361 specimen cet. ι 186 ipsa dedit specimen
natura creandi. 1364 pullorum: Cato de re rust. 51 ab arbore abs
terra pulli qui nascentur, eos in terram deprimito: the verb pullulo is
more common in this sense. eaeamina I do not find elsewhere thus
applied: suboles proles propaqo are similarly transferred from plants to
6111111618. 1367 foll. comp. Virg. geor. 11 35 proprios yeneratim dis-
cite cultus, Ayricolm, fructusque jeros mollite colendo. 1368 mansue-
scere terram: see n. to IV 1282. 1369 indulyendo, colendo: men are
the subject of these gerunds‚ terram of mansuescere: see n. to 1 312
habendo. 1374 Caerula, the γλαυκᾶς φύλλον ἐλαίας. 1377 Omnia:
1066 latrant et vocibus omnia complent. 1378 Arbustis: 866 n. to 1
187: Lucr. uses arbusta continually for arbores, never arbustis for
arboribus which suits his v. 3 asrbustis therefore has here its usual mean-
ing, and is nowhere else found in his poem. opsita circum and intersita
are of course set in contrast. Wordsworth scenery of the lakes quotes
1370—1378 and says of them ‘ Lucretius has charmingly described a
scene of this kind’. The description is likewise eminently true of Italy,
and is singularly graphio and compressed.

1379—1435: birds taught men song 3 from the whistling of the
zephyr through reeds they learnt to blow through stalks: next the pipe
came into use, with which they amused themselves mid other kinds of
rustic jollity: with such music watchers would while away the time, and
derive 110 1688 1116681116 1311611 now is gotten from elaborate tunes: then
acorns skins beds of leaves were given up 3 'though fought for once as
eagerly as 111611 now strive for purple and gold: lust of gain and cares
came next to vex life. 1380 levia: Quintil. inst. 11 5 9 quae levis et
quadrata, sed virilis tamen compositio: v 12 18 116 shews whence the
metaphor comes: dum levia sint ac nitida, quantum valeant, nihil in
teresse arbitramur: levitas and λειότης are used in the same way. 1381
