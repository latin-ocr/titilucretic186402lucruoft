συμβεβηκότα λεγόμεναι the τοὶ κ. ὄλ. φύσ. λαμ. :omnis ut est per se
natura of 419 3 φύσεις being applied to body and void alike by the school
of Democritus and Epicurus. 44¹7 448 might be all expressed by
οὔτ’ αἰσθητόν οὔτε νοητόν. 448 apisci: so VI 1235 apisci contayia,
and v 808 terram radicibus· apti.

449—482 ε all other things are either inseparable properties or acci-
dents of matter or void: time also exists not by itself: from the things
that go on follows the feeling of past present and future: the actions
done at the siege of Troy for instance did not exist by themselves, but
were mere accidents of the men there or the places there: without body
and space nothing which there happened could have happened. 449
if quaec. cluent: sunt, after the common usage of Lucr., then cetera is
understood, all except body and void 3 but perhaps it here means ‘are
said to be', cluent (esse), by which he would chiefly refer to the stoicS,
who so greatly extended the notion of body and void. coniuncta and
eventa appear to have been devised by Lucr. himself to distinguish the
two kinds of συμβεβηκότα or accidentia, the καθ’ αὑτά or per se, and
those not so: the editors after Lamb. quote a passage of Porphyry and
decide that coniuncta = συμβεβηκότα, eventa ε συμπτώματα. The truth is
that in the passage quoted above from Epicurus, as well as in 67 and 68
of the same letter συμβεβ. and συμπτ. are synonymeS, denoting either
kind of accident 3 just as Aristotle uses perpetually συμβεβηκός both for
his καθ’ αὐτὰ συμβ. and for the μή καθ’ αὐτός see last chap. of metaph. v 3
and Cicero in the passage cited to 419 uses quaeque his accidant for both
kinds. Plut. de plac. phil. 1 3 puts into Epicurus‘ mouth the words
συμβεβηκέναι τοῖς σώμασιν τρία ταῦτα σχῆμα μέγεθος βάρος-ε Ι might
cite many passa-ges from Sextus of the quite indifferent use of the two
terms: compare adv. math. x 221 which bears directly on what follows,
τούτων τῶν συμβεβηκότων ‘td μέν ε’στιν ἀχώριστα τῶν οἷς συμβέβηκεν, vd
δὲ χωρίζεσθαι τούτων πέφυκεν. ἀχώριστα μὲν οὖν ἐστὶ τῶν οἷς συμβέβη-
κεν ὦσπερ ἦ ἀντιτυπία μὲν τοῦ σώματος, εἶξις δὲ τοῦ κενοῦ. [454 might
have been forged from this clause.]...013x οἷχώριστα δέ ἐστι τῶν οἷς συμ-
βέβηκεν καθοῖπερ ἦ κίνησις καὶ ἦ μονή. 452 seque qreqari: 651 disque
supatis: so inque merentes, inque peditur, inque pediti etc. inque tueri,
inque qravescunc, inque qredi,· conque qlobata, conque qreyantur, conque
putrescunt, perque forare, proque voluta, praeterque meantum, praeter
creditur ire, ‘rareque facit, inter enim iectast, inter enim fuqit, inter
quasi rupta, inter enim saepit, inter quasi rumpere ,· perque plicatis,-
inter enim cursat: even inter quaecumque pretiantur, and facit are 3 though
he does not rival Ennius' cere conminuit hrum.

459 foll. here too Lucr. is combating Chrysippus and the porch
who taught that time was not only ἀσώματον, but also like void καθ’ αὑτό
