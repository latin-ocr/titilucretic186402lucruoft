N. Heins. in ms. notes. 105 must be spurious: some reader, with
reference to the cetera of 104, wrote in the margin cetera: Paucula
quae porro maynum per inane vomantur, on the model of 109 Multaque
. . . . This cetera then usurped the place of the words at the beginning
of 106, one of which must have been a relative to the antecedent haec of
107, 13116 other an adversative particle. I therefore long ago replaced
cetera by sed quae. Lachmann's text is utterly without logical sequence:
he has no stop at horum, and a period at end of 105: nor have the older
editions done better. 112 memoro rei Vat. 1706 Reg. (‘ olim Nicolai
Hensii’) Avanc. vulg. for memoror rei. 118 proelia puynas: so IV.
1009. proelia puynasque Gamb. J unt. wrongly. 125 maqis haec. ‘ Ma-
rull. contra v. l. scripserat, huc’ Gif.; but both Ald. 1 and J unt. have
maye ad hoc.- see above p. 8. 137 Ipsaque proporro Turneb. advers.
v 2¹7 Lach. for Ipsaque porro. Ipsaque quae Camb. vulg. Ictaque quae
Flor. 31.

152 quasi dum diverberet. quasi for quosi Pontanus, says Lamb.
quod sol diverberat Nic. Nicc. Flor. 31 Oamb. vulgo Lamb. ed. 1. quas-i
tum diverberet Lamb. ed. 2, quasi dum diverberat ed. 3¹, ‘ pessime’ says
Lach. : ‘nam dum intellegendum est donec.' But in my opinion, though
the subj. is quite right, Lamb. well defends the indi-c. which is also
tenable. 158 remoratur Ald. 1 J unt. for remoravit. 159 ipsa, suis 6
partibus una, Unum Ed. for ipsa suis 6 partibus unum Unum. The
contrast with 153-156 shews this to be necessary: comp. also 1 599
6130. The repetition of unum unum has here no force whatever. 160
coniza. conexa mss. eonnioea Ver. Ven. followed by N auger. and vulgo,
not by Avanc. or J unt. It should be coniaea.

165—183 Lach. has most justly marked off from the context, as
interrupting the argument, though indisputably written by Lucretius.
Some verses too have clearly been lost before 165. Bern. puts 167 before
165, and in 166 reads persectati, and supposes 110 lacuna. 168 numine
credunt Ed. for numine reddi: the e of numine has absorbed the c, and

, redunt in mss, much resembles reddi. rentur J unt. and vulgo ‘prorsus

egregie' says Lach. Wak. absurdly defends reddi. 169 has been much
tampered with in the vulg. eds. without any reason. 181 tanta stat
praedita Lach., as in the repetition v 199, for quamquam predita. quae
tanta est praedita Junt. and vulgo, which may be right. Wak. adopts
the interpolation of Nic. Nice. quamquam liaeo sint praedita, and gives a
ludicrous explanation of it.

193 subiyente Lamb. Oreech. Lach. for subiecta. subeunte Bern.
which is hardly so near the ms. reading. 194 Quod qenus 6 nostra
Quod ¹qenus est Lach. justly blamed by Madvig Lat. gram. ed. 3 p. lx
for the way in which he deals with quod 9enus here and in other places.
