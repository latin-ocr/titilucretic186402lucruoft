30 NOTEs 1

which the poet passed from Venus to Memmius: he suggests animum-

que, aye, Memmi, which would complete the sentence 111 3 way.
611· tollere. tendere Lamb. ed. 3 Lach. from Nonius ‘teste nostris

antiquiore’, But where our mss, give, as here, a faultless reading, it
seems uncritical to prefer that 01 such a careless writer as Nonius:
older and better authorities than he is continually misquote: Seneca in
57 has quoque for quove, Gellius 111 304 auc for et, 306 Nonius has
candenti 101· dispansae in, ΙΙ 1001 Lactantius ficlyentia 101· rellatum.
68 fama. sana Bentl. and Lach. who says ‘fama 11011 omnis necessario
mayna est’: fana may be right: see V 753 but fama deum seems to me
more emphatic and the deum to be equivalent to an epithet. 70 effrin-
9ere Priscian and also I find Flor. 29 and Vat. 1136 Othob. for con-
fiinyere, rightly no doubt. virtutem animi confrinqere Nic. Nicc.

104 possunt J unt. 101· possum. As A and the Italians have iam,
B and Gott. me, I once thought the right reading might 110 a me fin-

141 quemvis sufferre Flor. 32 111 margin, Nic. Heinsius in ms. notes,
and Faber for quemvis efferre. Dion. Cat. distich. 111 6 has quemvis
sufferre laborem, perhaps taken from this. 155—158 J unt. and margin
of Oamb. have these vs. in right order, and et for ut in 157. Avancius
et, and at end 01 his edition of Oatu'll. 1502 has right order.

161—-164 are rightly thus punctuated by Lach. I find however
from his proof sheets that until the final revision he had with Wakef.
put 3 stop after volueres and armenta, and none after caelo. Lamb.

11 36 si in plebeia. si plebeia in J unt. and Lamb.: in all cases against
mss. and the usage of Lucretius. A v. has been lost between 189 and
190 which in Camb. Phil. J ourn. 1 p. 374 I have thus supplied Res

207 possint Ald. 1 J unt. for possent: a change which will often have to
be made: mss. like schoolboys are more apt to put possent for possint
than vice versa. 215 quicque Lamb. for quiequid.
