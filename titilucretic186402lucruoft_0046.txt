28 NOTEs 1

the most interesting points of the ancient orthography will be found in
various parts of our notes. Again in those many cases where the sound
was intermediate between u and i and the spelling therefore uncertain,
such as the termination of participles and words like lubet or libet, dis-
sipat or dissupat, quadrupes or quadripes and many others 1 have of
course submitted to the guidance of our mss as well as in the adoption
of e 01· o in vertere or vortere and the like: e is naturally the more com-
mon, yet vorti vorsum divorsi vortitur convortere vorteae are all found.
The mss. too I have always followed in reading reddunda yiynurtdis
dicundum cernundi faciundum ayundis cet. or the more usual ayertdum
quaerendum cet. Do I then claim in all these doubtful cases to reproduce
the spelling of Lucretius or his first editor‘l Certainly not 3 but in most
of these cases Lucretius and his contemporaries undoubtedly allowed
themselves much latitude 3 and I have not intentionally permitted any-
thing to remain which might not have been found in one or other ms.
before the death of Virgil. By adhering tenaciously to the mss. where
not demonstrably wrong one gains a firm resting-place from which to
make further advances, if better evidence offer itselfi However that
may be, I cannot bring myself to accept the arbitrary and eclectio system
of a Wagner, much less the hideous barbarisms of a Wakefield3 nor on
the other hand, after feasting on the generous cereals of a Lachmann and
a Bitschl can I stomach the ‘conventional’ husks and acorns of the'
Italians of the 15th century. At the same time it will be seen that my
spelling differs less from this system, than does that of Wagner in his
standard text of 1841, or even his subsequent modification of that text
for common use which Prof. Conington has adopted in his Virgil.

Most of the abbreviations and marks used in the notes are sufficiently
explained above: A and B denote of course the two Leyden mss„ Gott.
the Gottorpian fragment, Nic. N icc. the Florentine ms. written by
Nicolo Niccoli, Flor. 29, 31, 32 the mss. of— the Laurentian library
forming Nos. 29, 31, 32 of desk xxxv3 Camb. our Cambridge ms.3
Vat. or Vatic. the Vatican mss.3 and Urbin. Othob. or Reg. with the
number attached identify them more nearly. Brix. Ver. Ven. Ald. l
J unt. Ald. 2 are the editions fully described above, where it has been ex-
plained when and why the names Avancius Candidus Marullus Naugerius
are or are not used instead of that of one or other of these editions.
The ms. notes of Heinsius and Vossius, which are often cited, indicate of
course the notes by those scholars which are in my private possession
and have been described above. Lamb. Wak. Lach. Bern. Bentl. need
no explanation after what has been said. The dots imply that one
verse, ,ιε that more than one or an uncertain number are lost 3 such inter-
polations as it has been deemed advisable to retain in the text, are
printed in small capitals 3 the letters syllables and words which are
omitted in the mss. but can be restored with more or less certainty, are
given in Italics. In quoting Ennius the last edition, that of Vahlen, has
been used 3 for the fragments of the Roman scenic writers, except
Ennius, that of Ribbeck: in citing Cicero the smaller sections are re·
fet-red to as far the most convenient: for Terence Fleckeisen3 for
Plautus Ritschl and Fleckeisen in the plays they have published 3 in the
others the old variorum ed. has been employed: in Pliny Sillig's sections
