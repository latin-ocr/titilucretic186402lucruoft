1061 coluerint. cooluerint Lamb. for colerunt. Lach. inserts an ut before
semina in 1059, and reads coluerunt here. colarunt Nic. Nicc. 3 Vat. J unt.
coierunt B corr. Flor. 31 Camb. l Vat. 1061 coniecta of all mss. seems
to me quite right: comp. 1108. convecta Lach. which appears 130 be
the right reading in the nearly identical passage v 429 where the mss.
have conventa. Lach. objects 130 coniecta ‘quasi Lucretius hic aliter
quam in quinto dicere potuerit': but there he has also conveniant, here
coluerint, there saepe, here semper,· for Lach. vainly alters saepe to
semper: he also says of coniecta ‘ sententiam non explet nisi addita loci
significatione, ut paulo post Conicere in loca quaeque’ cet: but 1 284
Fraqmina coniciens silvarum arbustaque tota, we find it used absolutely.
1062 exordia Ald. 1 J unt. for ex ordine, as in the 5th book.

1070 et. ex Lach. but et is clearly right: ex makes the construction
most awkward: then 1072 Visque eadem et natura Ald. 1 J unt. for Vis
eadem natura. Quis eadem natura Lach. 1079 aliquoiu’ siet Gronov.
for aliquoiuis siet B, alioquoiuis A: the older editors have gone widely
astray. 1080 inclute Memmi Gronov. for indice mente. 1081 Invenies
Ald. 1 J unt. for Invenisse. 1082 qenitam Ald. 1 J unt. for qeminam.
1089 quod his qeneratim rebus abundans mss. est Lach. for liis. hic...
abundat Bern. liic qeneratimst rebus abundans Ed. 1094 mss. giving
vltam for vitam have caused J unt. Wak. etc. to err strangely: simple as
it is, Avanc. first saw the truth. 1102 in added by Lactan. inst. 111 17
Flor. 31 Ver. Ven. etc.

1110 Appareret Nic. Nice. Camb. for appariret. Politian in marg.
Flor. 29 says ‘in vetusto Appareret:' was this the ms. of Poggio‘l in 716
to infra he has in marg. ‘ P inter,' with dots added, is P Poggio‘l AB
there have inte. 1115 aether added by Flor. 31 Camb. etc. a'e‘raque ae‘r
Lach. but see notes 2. 1116 extremam...flnem Lach. rightly for extre-
mum...flnem, as this is the only place where the mss. make finis masc.

. perfica AB Nonius. perfice A corr. Nic. Nicc. Flor. 31 Camb. etc. 1120

Jiic Ed. for liis, as in 1089. his rebus here has no more sense than there.
1122 ἠίῖαν...αεῖααοέα ΑΒ. hilari Avanc. hilaro more rightly Lamb.
1126 dispessa Ed. for dispersa: comp. 111 988 dispessis membris. dispersa
has here no sense: a full-grown man is more dispessus, but not more dis·
persus than a child. dispessa is the same as the res amplior et latior of
1133. 1135 ab se Lach. for a se, Lucr. as a rule using ab before s.- but
I have my doubts here: see Lach. 130 vi 925: Lucr. may have varied his
usage. 1136 diditur Ald. J unt. for deditur. 1138 queat J unt. for
queant. 1139—1142 (1146—1149): Goebel quaest. Lucr. crit. p. 33
has first seen that these verses are to come after 1138: the thing admits
of no question ε though it has escaped all the editors and Lach. 1140
