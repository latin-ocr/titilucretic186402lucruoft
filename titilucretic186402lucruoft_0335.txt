BOOK 1v 317

1232 virum suboles would commonly mean the whole male sex3 so
in Cic. omnem iuventutis subolem = omnem iuventutem 3 proles illa futu-
rorum hominum: futuri homines 3 and Virgil has prolem parentum for
the stock to which the parents belong: Pliny Sarmatae Medorum suboles,
of the same stock as the Medes: Lucr. himself 11 662 equorum duellica
proles; v 856 procudere prolem: 850 procudere saecla, their? race 3 and
111 741 triste leonum seminium=tristes leones, where see note3 IV 998
catulorum blanda propaqo = catuli blandi. But here virum suboles
means one out of the male sex 3 exactly as Hor. od. 111 13 8 Lascivi
suboles qreqis means one out of the suboles lascivi qreqis i. e. a kid3 for
lascivus qreoe cannot possibly mean anything but the young kids: in no
other way can I understand sanquis meus, qenus deorum, deum qens
and the like, than as meaning belonging to my blood, one of the 1366 of
gods ete: Aen. x 228 deum qens, Aenea seems synon. with VIII 36 sate
qente deum: so too I understand VI 792 divi qenus compared with divum
qenus3 and Lucr. 1 42 Memmi propaqo compared with IV 998 catulorum
propaqO. oriqo has here the meaning of partus or birth: perhaps mul.
or. is literally the beginning of a woman.

1233—12'7'7: it is not the gods who grant or withhold offspring:
conception depends on the due assortment of man and wife. 1233
cuiquam Absterrent: see n. to 1064. 1236 Quod cet.: VI 1015 Quod
facit et sequitur. 1237 adolent: Aen. v 54 strueremque suis altaria
donis, XI 50 cumulatque altaria donis being compared, this ambiguous
word would seem to have the sense here of causing to grow, increasing,
and so pfling up: Virg. geor. IV 379 Panchaeis adolescunt iqnibus arae,
adolescunt seems 10 be its neut., grow or are piled up: but in Lucr.
‘cause 10 smell' or ‘ burn' would give a suitable sense: see Conington
10 Virg. ecl. VIII 65. The 11011011 of increase would appear 10 be 15116
1110315 113111131, if 1116 word had come 10 be merely one of good omen and
conveyed only a conventional meaning 10 3 Latin ear. 1239 sortis:
Cic. de div. 11 86 says hoc quidem qenus divinationis vita iam communis
explosit. fani pulchritudo et vetustas Praenestinarum etiam nunc retinet
sortium nomen, atque id in volqus: these Praenestinae sortes he de-
scribes 1.1. 85 as in robore insculptas priscarum litterarum notis. Ritschl
Rhein. mus. n.f. XIV p. 389 foll. emends and explains some very singular
old hexameters, containing a series of sortes, such as these must have
been. fatiqant: 11 1172 caelumque fatiqat. 1242 locis adfi adh.

seems not unlike Aen. 1x 536 Et flammam adfiaeit lateri. 1244 his
i. e. 31113, 111111 reference 10 1240 partim. 1246 penetratum, because
penetro and penetro me in are equally in use. 1250 Succipiunt: v 402

succepit A: Ribbeck admits 11113 form four times 11110 1116 Aeneid with
more or less 1113. authority 3 and. Servius thrice repeats that succipio is
the old form. inqravescunt seems not to occur elsewhere in this peculiar
