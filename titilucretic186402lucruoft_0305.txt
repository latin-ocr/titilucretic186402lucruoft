Dextera sim. i. e. images turned as a man would be if looking at him-
self, right answering to right, left to left3 whereas, as he has just ex-

but only twirled round so as to be turned like a man looking at himself.

in duodecim menses describit annum. The phenomenon described by
Lucr. in these last verses is quite true and simple, whatever be said of
his explanations of it, on which indeed he seems not himself to lay much
stress. Editors are strangely at sea about a very easy matter. From
seeing my image turned upside down in the bowl of a silver spoon I
hastily concluded, as I find Gassendi has done, that a concave mirror
always gave an image thus inverted. A distinguished mathematical
friend 1138 however proved to me both by optical and ocular demonstra-
tion that this inversion is caused by the vertical, not in the least by the
lateral curvature. A mirror, latei-ally concave, such 38 Ι have before
1110111118 very moment, gives back your image turned 38 Lucr. asserts,
i. e. facing you just as if you were facing yourself, right answering to
right, left to left. Probably the Romans had metal mirrors of this
shape for the purpose of getting such an image 3 the other side being
convex, so as to suggest to Lucr. his comparison ‘lateris nostri’. 323
(347) ad aequos flexus ε very probably he refers to the angle of reflexion
being equal to the angle of incidence. ¹
