arranged by Lach. after Reisacker quaest. Lucr. last page3 and the
necessity of this change is manifest, though Macrob. 1. l. evidently read
them in the order in which they appear in our mss. See what I say on

has come from 470. 471 secata. ‘secuta et Y ' (i. e. our A) says Haver-
camp. This is quite false: though he had A and Β before him, he has
chosen to copy out this, as well 38 three fourths of his worthless various
readings, from the bookseller Tonson's London ed. of 1712, which gives
‘collationes trium ms. codicum Vossii a Rd⁰ Viro ΒΨ Oannon S. Τ. P.
factas': this collator says ‘secuta, dt. V. 1.’ Haverc. copies even the
comma and the <Kc into his ecl. This is but one of a thousand instances
of his unprincipled sloth. 472 476 Ῑηῦεφαιφπᾳαε Lach. 38 before for
