BOOK 1 ’ 163

contrast between its shortness and its accentuation appear harsh: yet
Cicero does not object to the junction. 667 reparcent= simply par-
cent, as 593 revictazvicta: Plaut. truc. ΙΙ 4 25 reparcis saviiszvicis-
sim parciS. 670 671 are thrice repeated in the poem, Lucr. intending
thereby to lay stress on the doctrine involved : see the passage from Epi-
curus cited after 689. 670 quodcumque -- si quod or quoties aliquid:
then ltoc has reference to the whole of this clause, this passing out of the
fixed limits which held the thing in: it involves therefore the same
doctrine as 76 so often repeated, finita potestas denique cuique Quanam
sit ratione atque alte terminus haerens .· things have certain bounds
within which they may range and continue what they are 3 when this
limit is passed they die and pass into another condition. The expression
much resembles that of Epicharmus quoted by Diog. Laert. 111 11 ὃ δὲ
μεταλλάσσει κατὰ φύσιν κοῦποκ’ ἐν ταύτῷ μένει, ηΕτερον εἴη κα τόδ’ ἤδη τοῦ
’παρεξεστακότοῆ though the thought is different. 672 aliquit, quicquit,
aliut are not unfrequently met with in our mss: in A oftener than
B, once or twice in. both: the t has naturally been retained where no
ambiguity is occasioned, such as by at, quot for ad, quod.

675 Nunc iqitur: see n. to 169. certiss. corp. qa: see n. to 521.
677 abitu aut aditu: comp. 457 where the contrary is asserted of mere
eventa. 680 dec. ab. = abitu of 677,- alia adtr. z aditu: comp. 800
demptis paucis = abitu 3 paucis tributis = aditu. 683 omnimodis often
used by Lucr. as an adv. = omnibus modis: multimodis too is used by
him: multis modis: Cic. orator 153 saepe brevitatis causa contrahebant
ut ita dicerent multi’ modis, vas’ argenteis cet. 3 so that omnimodis seems
formed by Lucr. on a false analogy: there is no adj. omnimodus or multi-
modus, any more than omniyenus: omniyenum in Virgil is for omniqe-
narum: Lucr. uses omne yenus like id mnus, quod ¹oenus. 684 quaedam
corp. = certiss cor. qu. of 675 z corpora certa of 521: the atonis of course.
685 comp. 632—634. ordo positura fi9urae: these words repeated 11 1021
come from Democritus : see Arist. metaph. vm 2 p. 1042 b 11 Δημοκρίτῳ

ἢ διαθιγῇ ὅ ἐστι τάξις. 686 mutatoque cet. i.e. quaeque mut. ord. cet: see
n. to 718. 687 iyni sim: IV 363 paulum simulata. Fore. cites Aen. 111
349 and Cic. ad Att. lx 8 for the same sense. 688 rei gen. and dat. in
Lucr. either two long syll. or one: rei is not found: so ei: also fidei not
fidei, 689 adiectu: lv 673 naris adiectus adoris TanyatJ v 566 iynes
lumina possunt Adicere: the ad implies the reaching the object aimed
at. With the whole argument of 665—689 should be compared Epi-
curus himself in Diog. Laert. X 54, τοῖς α’,τόμους νομιστέον μηδεμίαν ποιό-
