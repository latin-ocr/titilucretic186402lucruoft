52 NOTEs 1

bram A Nic. Nice. Camb. which may be right: comp. Plaut. rud. 588
Quasi vinis Graecis Neptunus nobis suffudit mare. 305 pavoris Ald. 1
J unt. for vaporis. 306 I nter utrosque sitast Avanc. (sita est J unt.) for
Inter utrasque sitas. sitas of mss. must be sitast: the scribe has then
adapted utrasque to sitas. I uterutraque secus Lach. Interutraque secat
Bern. 309 Naturae Juut. for Natura. 317 quot. quod AB, which
Lucr. may have written: see Lach. 319 videor Faber for video. firmare
Ver. Ven. etc. for formare. 321 ‘nobis Lach. for noctis. dictis Ald. l
J unt. Lamb. ed. 1 and 2. doctis Lamb. ed. 3.

332 flunt consorti...vita J unt. first for consorti fiurit...vitae. 333
though sound, is much corrupted by ,J unt. Lamb. vulg. 335 eas Lach
for eos,· as eos is contrary to the usage of Lucr. 346 reposta Avanc. for
reposto. reposti J unt. without sense, not repostis. 347 ut added by
J unt. 350 refutat. renutat Lamb. 358 is justly ejected by Creech in
notes and Bern. Lach. keeps it, but for illultaque reads Nullaque which
seems scarcely to be Latin. Lamb. condemns 357 which Creech well

defends.

361 Difficilest. Desiperest Lamb. ed. 2 and 3 Gif. Lach.: but see
notes 2. dicat Lamb. for ducat. 362 Lamb. most justly rejects: it is a
manifest gloss to explain the corrupt ducat. Lach. puts it after 363,
and gives a most unnatural explanation. 365 quia Lach. for qua.

372 privis, 378 and 380 priva Bentl. for primis and prima: 389
priva is in the mss. 374 animae elementa minora AB Nic. N icc. Brix.
Ver. Ven.: this I have retained. animai el. miri. Flor. 31 Oamb. Ald. l
J unt. vulgo 3 but the elision is not tolerable. elementa minora animai
Lach. 375 e AB Lamb. ed. 3 Creech Lach. rightly. et A corr. B corr.
Nic. Nicc. Flor. 31 Camb. all Vat. all eds. bef. Lamb. 3, Gif. Wak. 383
aranei Ald. 1 J unt. for arani: see Lach. 391 ciendum Avanc. for ciendo.
392 and 393 first placed in their right order by J unt. 394 Εὐ quam in
his intervallis Lach. acutely for Et quantis int. E't quam intervallis
tantis Ald. 1 J unt. vulgo. Et tantis intervallis Wak.

400 et discedit Vat. 3276 Ald. 1 J unt. for edisceclit. 403 circun
Flor. 31 Oamb. corr. for cretum. 404 remota B corr. Lach. for remot B,
remotus A. remotis vulg. 405 aetherias. aerias Lach.: without any
just cause he alters this and many other passages of Virgil and others on
the assumption that aetheriae cannot be joined with aurae. 411 Et.
Sed. J unt. Lamb. etc. wrongly. 412 and 415 are necessary 130 complete
the comparison between the hall and pupil of the eye and 13116 anima and
animus. Lach. is therefore quite wrong in ejecting them. But in 415
alioqui is corrupt. I have there transposed a single letter and written
aliquoi, adding sit which could easily fall out before splendidus. 412
Lamb. ruins the sense by reading conflet for ‘non fiet.

420 Diona tua. . .cura Lach. for Diyria tua. . mita. Perpetua. ..vita Bern.
with reference I presume to 13 perpetua semper dignissima vita : but surely
diaria 01 diqnissima would be required. Diyua tuo. . ,vate Creech: but vates
to Lucr. had only a bad meaning. 421 utrumque uui subiunyas nomen
eorum Lach. for u. urio s. nome e: the lost u of this v. having much the same
place as the lost c of the preceding: but perhaps Lucr. wrote utrumque
uno sub iunyas nomine eorum, which is nearer the ms. reading and
agrees better with what next follows. 428 Ι retain the ms. reading.
