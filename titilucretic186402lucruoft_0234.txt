V 146 foll. and 1161 foll. more will be said on this question: that Epi-
curus and Lucr. firmly believed in the existence of these gods is certain:
how this immortality and supreme felicity can be reconciled with the
rest of their philosophy, it were vain to ask 3 for no answer could be
given. Did the gods exist from all eternity‘l or had they a beginning 2
The words of Ennius trag. 353 are well known, E90 deum 9enus esse
semper dixi et dicam caelitum, Sed eos non curare opinor quid ayat
humanum yenus. 646 with Omnis divom natura comp. 757 si nulla
coloris principiis est Reddita natura 3 1 710 in rerum naturas vertier
omnis: he usually gives the epithet to natura, not to the substantive
depending on it: see n. to 1 281 mollis aquae natura 3 and comp. also 1
962 haec sensus natura. divom natura seems to be a mere periphrasis
for divi 3 as 1 194 natura animantum for animantes. 649 privata
= expers, is very common in Lucr. as 111 905 cunctis privatu' doloribus
aeyris. 652 (655) Neptunum, as he himself does 472 Neptuni corpus,
653 (656) Bacchi nom. as he does himself 111 221 Bacchi cum flos
evanuit: but in these verses he doubtless points at the stoics who carried
allegory of this kind to an absurd length: see what the stoic Balbus
says in Cic. de nat deor. 11 50 foll. Every part of heaven and earth was
thus parcelled out among the gods and demigods, and fatuous deri-
vations assigned to their names by Zeno Cleanthes Chrysippus and other
leaders. 658—660 (652—654> see notes 1 3 and for an explanation of
this transposition see above p. 22. 659 potitur primordia: the same
constr. is found 111 1038 Sceptra potitus, and 1v 760 quem...potitast: the
latest editors appear to banish it wholly from Cicero 3 but the best mss.
of the auctor ad Herenn. 1v 57 have potitus est qloriam: this constr. is
very common in the fragments of the old tragic writers,

661—699 : in this way sheep horses cattle eating the same grass and
drinking from the same river all keep their distinctive differences: thus
grass and each river must contain most different elements: nay the
parts of the same animal are quite different3 and are formed therefore
of different elements: then too fuel must contain elements of fire and
fiame and ash: then many things have divers properties, colour flavour
smell 3 and these have all different elements as they enter things in dif-
ferent ways: things therefore must be of mixed seed: again as the same
letters are common to different words, so the same elements may be
common to most different things, to men corn trees. 661 itaque
manifestly refers to Multa modis multis effert: with these words in their
old place it has no meaning: the thread of the argument dropped at 599
is again resumed, i. e. the great variety of elements the earth contains.
662 duellica: so duellum duellatores, perduellis which always remained

in use, Duelonai in an old inscription, duonoro (bonorum) on the tomb -

of the Scipios: Lach. quotes from Plautus capt. prol. bellique dvellatores
