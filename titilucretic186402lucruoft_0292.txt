occidissent. Gnaeus and Publius were great generals, perhaps not infe-
rior to the more fortunate nephew and son 3 but still when they met so
disastrous an end, it is singular Cicero should call them the two thun-
derbolts of the empire. When we think of the words scipio and scapus,
and the English skaft, and σκίπων σκᾶπτον σκῆπτρον, a-nd then σκηπτός
σκήπτω and cognate words, and their connexion with the thunderbolt‚
we might be tempted to think that the Scipios loved to refer their name
to it rather than to the more homely staff. I find but one recorded coin
of the family, and it has on the reverse a Jupiter with thunderbolt in
the right and sceptre in the left hand 3 which might recall both meanings
of the word. Valerius Max. 111 5 1 has this remarkable expression in
relating the degeneracy of Scipio’s son, dii boni, quas tenebras e quo ful-
mine nasei passi estis! 1035 famul inf : after Eun. ann. 317 e reyno
summo ut famul infimus [mss. optimus] esset. Paulus Fest. p. 87
‘famuli origo ab Oscis dependet apud quos servus famel nominabatur’:
with famul may be compared the many words ending in r which have
lost the final us, as puer vesper ayer socer tener and the like. 1037

turpi. 1039 mat. vetustas: his age at his death is variously given
from 90 to 109 years. 1040 memores motus would produce memory,
and thereby the power of consistent thought, just as the semiferi motus
produce sense. Lucr. by placing Democritus here would seem to give
him rank next to Epiculus: he thus displays a more thankful sense of ’
obligation than his master is recorded to have done.

1042 obit decurso· Lach. in his elaborate note, after attempting to
prove that the last syll. of iit and its compounds 1s always long, proceeds
to shew that Lucr. could not have used the contracted form obit before
a consonant: why‘l because the poets have three different usages in re-
gard to these forms, a few, Phaedrus Seneca Silius, admit them only
before consonants or at the end of a verse, the old comic poets either
before a vowel or consonant, most, Virgil Ovid Lucan Statius Mar-
tial and others, only before a vowel: now Lucr. twice uses them before
a vowel, IV 339 (314) Ater init oculos, 771 perit alioque 3 unless therefore
he chose to descend to the level of a comic poet, he could not also say z
obit decurso, as he had taken his stand on the other practice. This
curious conclusion is refuted by Luc. Mueller cle re metr. p. 399 in a few
lines: Martia] Lucan Statius are placed by Lach. in the third and
most correct class ; but Martia] not only says 1 62 6 abit Helene, 11 64 3
