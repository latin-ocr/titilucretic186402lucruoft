theu must it perish thus diffused 3 even as food transmitted into the
body perishes and then furnishes out of itself another nature: thus the
80111 that entered will die, and another be formed out of it ε thus still
the 80111 will be mortal. 681 vitae limen: he has Zeti limen several
times: see n. to II 960. 682 conveniebat i. e. vivere from 684.
688 sensu partia: Plaut. miles 262 has the same constr.: non poluit
quin sermone suo aliquem familiarium Partioipaverit cle amica eri.

v 343: so VI 460 Quam sint quoque maqis: quique too is of course the
abl. 3 and there can be no doubt of the reading, which is natural enough,

corpore fusa = soluta et mixta cum corpore. '710 tum at the time
when this theory supposes it to enter the body.

'713—740: are atoms of the 80111 left behind in the dead body or

of itself behind 3 if it goes out entire, whence come worms and other
living things into the carcass'l but if 801118 001110 from without into these
myriads of 0103111108, do they each create a body for itself, or enter

they could not make it: if again they entered it already made, they could
not unite with it so closely as to have sensation in common. '713 lin-

loquuntur: all these forms probably, except the last, were in the mss. of
Lucr. within a generation of his death: a proof of the excellence of our

of the anima. '721 Eoeos is also found in his imitators Arnobius and
Serenus Samonicus. perfluctuat seems another ἅπαξ λεγ. '731
Dicere seems to be used here as a subs: comp. IV 765 meminisse iacet,
