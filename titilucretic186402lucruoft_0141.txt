εἶδος and ἰδέα of Democritus who also has φύσις and the strange δέν.

tion 1v 47 Quoque. v 71. 184 and 776 Quove: 168 and 176 are not in
point, as ve has there its proper force. VI 29 Quidve: 11 64 Quaeque:

quaest. Virg. xxxvl 5, where it appears that Virgil's usage is much the
same. One might suppose that this use began from a wish not to con-
found the relative with quisque : thus 111 34 Quoque modo possint res ex
his quaeque creari would have been ambiguous. As quicque, not quidque5
is the neut. of quisque, there would be no objection to quidque which is
found in v 185 3 'yet in 11 64 A Β Gott. etc. have also Quaeque 3 and 1v ’
634 and VI 533 quareve=quareque, which would not be ambiguous.

Lucr. has no objection to change to the nent: 157 res quaeque, 158 “

quaeque neut.: this of course has no bearing on Wakefield’s absurd argu-
ment that 190 Omoemus: ‘res crescentes. Lucr. like the older writers
generally, does not seem to have felt the ambiguity of perempta in the
neut. coming next to natura: comp. v 1414 1416 and 1417. 58 qen.

This paragraph, 50——61‚ is in many respects the least satisfactory in
the 1st book. It has no connexion with what precedes: but that, as we
have seen may be owing to the accidental loss of some verses: it has no
proper connexion with what follows 3 for the poet passes on to Epicurus,
almost as abruptly as he left Venus for Memmius. Next let us test the
passage itself: he tells Memmius what he is going to sing of: first of
heaven and the gods. That occupies only a portion of books 5 and 6.
Then in the rest of the paragraph he says he will explain the nature of
his first-beginnings. That explanation fills a part of books 1 and 2.
Thus he puts what is to come in the last two books before what comes
in the first two 3 and he says not a word of the matters discussed in the
rest of these four books and in the whole of the 3rd and 4th. Then the
language of 56—61 seems clumsy disjointed and ill-arranged. If now
we turn to 127-135, we see that he first repeats in other words
