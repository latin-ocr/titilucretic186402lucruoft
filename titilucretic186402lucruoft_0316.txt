111 219, where see note. 651 ipso refers to ore as well as palato,
they being singled out from the other membra, as those which have to
do with taste. 652 maioraque i.e. quaedam maiora: comp. n. to 518.

tans. 668 corpora 16 1116 levissima of 659. 669 cetera: Aspera
nimirwm hamataque of 662. 671 Lachmann's note is quite beside the
point: he gains nothing by transposing these vss.; for, as just shewn‚
the quae corpora of 668 and the cetera of 669 are the very levissima and
Aspera respectively‚ for which he makes his transposition. I now
incline to reject also Bernays’ notion of a lacuna: the mention of honey
is somewhat abrupt 3 but that is explained by the fact that it was pro-
verbial as an illustration of the merely relative notion of sweet and
bitter: thus Sextus pyrrh. hyp. 11 63 ἐκ τοῦ τὸ μέλι τοῖσδε μὲν πικρόν
τοῖσδε δὲ γλυκι) φαίνεσθαι ὁ μὲν Δημόκριτος ἔφη μήτε γλυκῦ αὐτὸ εἶναι μήτε
πικρόν, ὁ δὲ Ἡράκλειτος ἀμφότερα. Now Lucr. has just specified sever
with a flow of bile as the cause of this change of sweet to bitter: with

illustration from Hippocrates. 672 supera saepe in 11 and 111: comp.
11 391-407 with 111 189-195, from which it will appear that honey
has many smooth round atoms in it whence it gets its usually pleasant

⁹ flavour 5 but at the same time it has a constantior natura Et piqri latices

maqis et cunctantior actus than water, and therefore has more rough
and hooked atoms3 so that in peculiar states of the tongue and palate,
in sever for instance, these latter atoms happen to fit the pores better
than the smooth 01166, and produce a bitter flavour.

673—686: next to explain smell: it must stream on all sides from
many things3 but, as in taste, one kind suits one creature, another
another: bees are attracted from far by the smell of honey, and so on:
