does not shew on the whole more skill and finished workmanship, aud
his rhythm has a far less majestical march. Ovid in his hexameter
poem with all his ease and fluency does not make any advance upon,
but rather falls behind Virgil: his heroic wants body and flavour, va-
riety even. How inferior is he to Lucretius in those passages, in which
he seems to be competing with him! As for the slavish pack of imi-
tators who followed in the track of Virgil or Ovid, it were a. shame‘

even to discuss their claims to superiority.
One of the most marked peculiarities of the old Latin writers is

their extreme fondness for alliteration, assonance, repetition of the same
or similar words syllables and soundsg often brought together and com-
bined in the most complex fashion. In Latin, as in some other languages,
this usage was clearly transmitted from most ancient times, and is not
the invention of any one writer. Ennius and the serious writers use it
to produce a poetieal effect3 Plautus and the comic pocts employ it for
comic purposes: the following from the captivi, Quanta per-nis pestis
veniet, quanta labes larido, Quanta sumini apsumedo, quama callo cala-
mitas, Quanta laniis lassitudo, quanta porcinariis, will furnish a good
example. Cicero does not despise such artifices even in prose ς but none
scatters them about more prodigally than Lucretius both singly and in
manifold combination: they are to be counted in his poem by hundreds,
nay thousands, and many are noted in different parts of our commentary.
His alliterations comprise almost every letter of the alphabet: the more
effective letters such as m p v pronounced w are often used with striking
effect. The last sometimes expresses pity as its sound well fits it to do:
Viva videns vivo sepeliri viscera busto: comp, Virgil’s Nea patriae validas
in viscera vertite vires,· and Cicero's vivus, ut aium, esc et m‘dens oum
victu ac vestitu suo publicatus: or force or violence, because the words in·-
dicating such effects begin many of them with the letter: vivida vis per·
vicit, venti vis verberat, ventorum validis viribus, Vel viole-nea viri vis,
quid volnera vellent: comp. Virgil's Fit via vi, Livy’s vi viam faciunt,
Ennius’ vidi Priamo vi vitam evitari ‚· for effects of living shunning and
the like are expressed by it in Lucretius also. Often various letters
are used in combination: the following is a good instance of m p and υ.-
parare Non potuit, pedibus qui pontum per vada possent Transire et
maynos ‘manibus divellere montis Multaque vivendo vitalia vincere saecla:
comp. Ennius' λίανεα manus, Paeliyna cohors, Vestina virum vis. Such
combinations are common in Virgi13 but occur by hundreds in Lucretius.
Then he delights in bringing together words compounded of the same
preposition by themselves or in union with other sorts of alliteration or
assonance: officium. ..officere atque obstare, seiuozqi seque yreqari, dis-
