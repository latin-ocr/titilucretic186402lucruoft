this case is almost unexampled: vl 805 odor viri is used for the pungent
fumes of charcoal. 859 Cetera without et: so 1085 3 and thus I read
in 1v 419: it is found in Cicero, as topica 27. tamen, as so often,
implies something understood: all these, whatever they are, however
11111011 they differ, are yet of such sort as to be liable to death, whether
they are Molli lenta or etc.: the molli lenta seems to refer to fire and
heat, fraqosa putri to ice- and cold, cava corp. raro to flavour sound
smell3 as they are all material and would seem, where he describes
them, to be of bodies severally like these. 860 fra908a=fragilia: a
sense which the word seems nowhere else to bear. 862 subiunyere
appears to be the opposite of seiuncta in the preceding verse: such
things must be detached, imperishable foundations attached to things.
865—885: all things which have sense come from insensible ele-
ments: a visible proof of this you may see in living worms rising from
the putrid earth: again grass and water change into cattle, the fiesh of
cattle into men, men often go to seed beasts and birds: nature turns
food into what has life and sense, much as dry wood passes into fiame 3
so much is effected by transposition and mixture and motions of ele-
ments.——That the soul, the vital principle and sense were born and died
with the body in all creatures, was of course a necessary doctrine of the
epicureans and is passionately asserted by Lucr. throughout the third
book. 866, 870 and 888 insensilibus: this word as well as sensilis
seems peculiar to Lucr. among writers of authority: Arnobius his con-
stant imitator has insensilia. 869 ipsa manu ducunt: Aen. 111 372
I pse manu multo suspensum numine ducit, literally: the metaphor is ob-
vious3 χειραγαηιεῖν 10 common in the later Greek writers. 871 foll.
this illustration, important from his point of view, he often repeats 3 see
898, 928, 111 719, v 797 : Aristotle and the old physiologists seem to ac-
cept it as an undoubted fact. 872 putorem: 929 putor, VI 1101
putorem: all of the rottcnness of the earth after rain 3 though putor in
Varro de ling. Lat. v 25 and elsewhere is said of a putidus odor: Lamb.
and others would read in all these cases putrer. 8¹74 itidem i.e. inan-
imate things into living and sensible. 878 pennipotentum: this ex-
pressive word recurs v 789. 881, flame seeming to be no more like
wood than a sensible to an insensible thing, adque B some six times,
A never: I doubt whether in such cases I have done right in retaining
it aster Lach.: it seems rather to have become common in the first cen· ⁷
tury and later from a false affectation of analogy: see 11. to VI 92 prae-
scribta, and to 11 141 Apparet, and introduction p. 26. Wagner forces

adque on Virgil in all cases, against the overwhelming testimony of mss.
883—885 repeated in substance 1007—1009.
