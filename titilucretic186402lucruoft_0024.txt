probus’ and other opprobrious names. That he got much assistance from
the labours of Marullus is certain 3 but by ascribing to the latter every-
thino that is in the J untine, in some respects more in others less credit is
giveii to him than he deserves. As I can throw some light on this
interesting question, I will examine it at some length here and in vari-

ous parts of notes 1. θ
Τ118 80110181· poet and soldier, Michael Tarchaniota Marullus Con-

stantinopolitanus, as 118 08118 himself in the editions of his poenis
printed during his life, appears from this title and his epitaph in
San Domenico at Ancona, where he and so many of his ancestors
are buried, as well as from the epithet Bizantius given to him by his
friend Petrus Crinitus, to have been born in Constantinople. As
he can hardly have passed middle life when he perished in the river
Cecina near Volterra April the lOth 1500, he must have been a mere
child when on the capture of his native city 118 was brought to Italy,
probably to Ancona. He must have received his training however
111 Florence, and 118 found a Maecenas in Lorenzo de’ Medici. Though
he never printed anything on Lucretius, his manuscript emendations
appear to have been well known during his life, and a copy of the

“ poet to have been found on him at his death: ‘ex miseranda illa

in mediis Cecinae undis Latinarum musarum iactura cladeque insigni
unus est Lucretius receptus' says Candidus in his preface3 and his
friend Petrus Crinitus in his de honesta disciplina xv 4, published
in 1504, but mostly written it would seem before Marullus’ death,
after well refuting an alteration of his which shall presently be referred
to, adds ‘quae ab eius quoque sectatoribus recepta sunt pro verissimis'.
This intense love of Lucretius he seems only to have conceived in the
latter years of his life. Candidus, whose preface full of feeling shews
that he greatly loved Marullus and deeply deplored his untimely end,
strives to make the most of what he did: he says ‘'Lucretianae adeo
veneris per omnem aetatem studiosus fuit, ut cet.' But this must be an
exaggeration: the first edition of his poems, published without a date,
containing only two books of epigrams, shews so far as Ι can see no
trace of any acquaintance with Lucretius. Catullus is chiefly imitated
even in the elegiacs, and next to him Tibullus and Horace. Six pages
from the beginning there is a poor poem of eight lines ‘de poetis
Latnis’ [sic], in which he says that Tibullus Maro Terence Horace
Catullus each in his kind are the only good Latin poets: Hoc si quis
inter caeteros ponet vates, oneret quam honoret verius. In december
1497, scarcely therefore more than two years before his death, he pub-
lished at Florence a much enlarged edition. A third and fourth book
of epigrams are added: in these too I find no trace of Lucretius.
Then follow four books of hymni naturales. In these, especially such as
are written in heroics, the strain is ‘of a higher mood', and we meet
with frequent imitations of Lucretius, even in the lyrics, as Opibusque
late pollens tuis which recalls Ipsa suis pollens opibus. But in these
heroics it is to be noticed that the rhythm is Virgilian, not in any
respect Lucretian even where he closely follows the latter's language, as
in the hymn to earth: Ante repentino caeli quam territus haustu Vaqiat
aetheriam in lucem novus editus infans. Cum proiectus humi nudus
