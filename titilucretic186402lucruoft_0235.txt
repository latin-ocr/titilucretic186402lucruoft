optumi, the u of such words in Plautus being generally, as here in
Lucr., a consonant 3 so‘Ennius perduellibus. 663 Buceriae: Nonius
Charisius Servius all attest the feminine: Lucr. in the neut. uses the
form bucera more than once. sub teq. caeli: see 1 992 (988). 667
Tanta cet. shewing therefore the manifold elements in the earth. 669
Hine porro, 671 porro, 673 Tum porro, as if the use of the word sug-
gested unconsciously its repetition. 678 and 682 iqitur: see 11. to 1
419: i9itur in 678 has the force which it not unfrequently has in the
old writers, as Plaut. miles 772 Quando habebo, iqitur rationem mearum
fabricarum dabo, the participial clause being equivalent to a protasis:
see Hand Turs. 111 p. 185. 679 fiyuras, 682 and 685 fiqwris see n.
to 385: in these three places the word clearly refers to atoms, but
may include also shapes of atoms 3 as it must so far have been am-
biguous to Lucr. 681 cum odore: see n. to 404. privis=singulis, is
often used by him. 683 and 684 fucus: color: so 744 nullo circumlita
fuco, and 1V 84 fucum Mittunt. 688—690=1 823—825. 691
multa parum: see n. to 336. 694=337=724.. 698 merito ex
aliis cet. though they have very many elements in common.

'700—'729 : but all elements cannot unite in all ways3 else monsters
of all kinds would arise: every creature has its fixed seeds, fixed mother 3
and thus is kept within its limits 3 and of the elements it takes as food
some only remain, others are rejected as unsuitable : and so it is with
inanimate as well as animate things ε they have each elements different
or differently combined 3 and the modes of action of these elements differ,
so that not only living bodies, but all nature, earth sea and heaven, are
kept distinct. 700 foll. this question is more fully discussed v 837-
924. 702 Semiferas the centaurs: comp. v 878 foll. 703 eyiyni
seems a ἅπαξ λεγόμ.; with 69. corp. comp. VI 761 Et quibus efflant
causis, and 11. to V 703 x Lamb. compares Hor. sat. 11 2 105 tanto eme-
tiris acervo 3 but such constructions are common enough. 704 116
speaks of Scylla: comp. V 893. 706 omniparens terra is found also
v 259 and in Virgil. '710 and 725 necessust: see n. to 289, and
Lach. VI 8153 who shews that Terence has necessus fuit, sit necessus3
Plautus necessumst, necessust, necesse est, all three forms found in Lucr.
but necessust in Plautus must surely be necessus est, and this contrac-
tion Lucr. would not use : are we to read necessumst here, or is there
a nom. neces-sul '711 intus i. e. when they are inside the body.
'714 reicere i. 6. the different excrements. multa caec. cor. . . e con: see
n. to 1 875, and 11 843 846 Corpora prima. . Nec iaciunt. . de corpore:
here in fact ‘multa would naturally agree with corpora3 so that we
should then have multa corpora Oorp. cae. fuq. e corpore. 717 con-
