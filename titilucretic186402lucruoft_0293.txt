7 7 2 perit fecit 3 Lucan not only has abit aut, but also 1x 205 obit Pom-
peio, 1098 perit caruere3 Statius not only subit ibi and the like, but
also Theb. vn 439 init fecitque, x 205 adit non: what Lach. says of
Virgil has some support from mss, but taking into account that poet's
usual rhythm it seems almost incredible that he should five times have
written emit, emit, brein-sic, transit, brein-sit 3 never once divided the word
between two feet, escit etc.: Martial does not hesitate to say transit
et: take audent fundunt or any other word of the same quantity and
see how the case stands with them. It may be said on the other side
‘ why is not exiit or transiit used by Virgil in the δ’ὑῘι foot2' but these
words only occur five times 3 and Ι find that he uses audiit 13 times in
all, 11 times in the first foot: of the two exceptions one is a case of re-
petition, Audiit . . audiit amnis. It is however possible, as I have
remarked to 776 conubia, that Virgil so placed these words as to give
his readers the choice of taking them for a dactyl or spondee, as they
pleased. Ovid's exceptional and repeated lengthening 01 interiit abiit
rediit etc. as well as petiit is evidently done in defiance, as if he would
say ‘ whoever is afraid to lengthen these words, I am not': his example
appears to me rather to go against than support Lach. 3 01 6186 why is he

uses the contracted perf. of the first conj. 1 70 Irritat, v 396 superat,

marked that the reading in the first two instances rests on a conjecture,
though a highly probable one.

1042 dec. lum. vitae: Lach. says ‘interpretes vitae lumen quomodo
decurratur. ,non recte explicant, scilicet obliti se in libro ΙΙ 79 legisse
Et quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt’: I much doubt this allusion,
and am disposed with Lamb. to look on it as a mixture of two meta-
phors, decurso vitae spatio and extincto lumine vitae: it may have
reference to the course of the sun. 1044 Restincoeit: Cic. orator 5
‘nec ipse Aristoteles admirabili quadam scientia et copia ceterorum studia
restinxit: the insertion of 0 before x is interesting as another proof that
doubling the consonant did not change the sound: cx 03 oe were all pro-
nounced alike, just as m 903 cs were: 866 11. 130 545 obbrutescat: it is
interesting too as a proof, if proof were needed, that as 9 became 0 before
