INTRODUCTION 27

guides, had he chosen to follow them. The mss. of Lucretius are no less
admirable and probably represent very fairly the author’s own usage:
they offer -is five times out of six 3 and -esis somewhat more common in
substantives in very general use, as iqnes vires aures. Inscriptions quite
bear out our mss.3 and the 3616 relic of Latin yet disinterred from Her-
culaneum contains this v. Utraque sollemnis iterum revocaverat orbes.
Pertz recently printed in the Berlin transactions the few remaining leaves
of a ms. of Virgil, which he assigns to the age of Augustus and which
may really be of the second or third century: we there find the acc. plur.
of adjectives and participles ending 18 times in -is, 3 times in -63, pares
felices amantes; of substantives we find sonoris, but 4 times vires, and
artes messes crates classes aves, quite bearing out the testimony of our
A and. B. Varro de ling. Lat. vm 67 says quial potest similius esse quam
gens mens dens‘l quom horum casus patricus et aecusativus in multitudine
sint disparilis; nani ct primo fit gentium et gentis, utrobique ut sit i 3
ab secundo mentium et mentes», ut in priore solo sit 1,· ab tertio dentum
et dentes, ut in neutro sit i: well our 11133. six times have the acc. qenti3‚
never qentes,· dentes four times, never dentis,· mentes five times, once only,
11 620, mentis. As for the nomin. plur. of such words, Varro 1.1. 66
says sine reprehensione vulqo alii dicunt in sinqulari hac ovi et avi, alii
liae ove et ave. in multitudinis kae puppis restis et hae puppes restes: the
fragment of Virgil just cited has the nomin. plur. putris and messis,
though we saw it had messes in the accus, : in accordance then with these
high authorities the mss. of Lucr. not unsre-quently retain this nomin. in
-is, which. it would be monstrous to extirpate: I have always therefore
kept it. We see from the corpus inscr. that -eis -is -63 were all in use: it
is probable that Lucr. occasionally employed the termination -eis, inter-
mediate in sound between -63 and -is,· but, if so, his manuscripts have left
few or no traces, and it would be most perverse to follow Avancius Wake-
field and others in thrusting it into his verses in season and out of season.
His 11133. have however left not a few traces expressed or implied of
the ending -ei: see n. to 111 97 oculei: these traces have of course been
carefully preserved.

On another question, comprehending a multitude of particular in-
stances, I have followed Lachmann and 6111· mss. which here too are 611
the whole excellent guides: I spe-ak of the vowel or consonant u followed
by another u. The old Latius appear to have been unable to pronounce
uu,· and therefore the ancient o long kept its place after u; or for qu 6
61· q was used: quom qum or cum, never quum ,· linquent linqunt or
lincunt, sequentur, sequntur or secuntur, equos (nom.) equs or 66113,- volqus
divos clivom aevom and so on They appear to have begun soonest to tolerate
uu in terminations, when both were vowels, suus tuus and the like. Now
the mss. of Lucretius have retained in very many instances clivom volnus
volqo vivont cet. 3 equos (nom.) and ecus ecum, aeeum; relinquont relinqunt
or relincunt oftener than relinquunt, so sequentur secuntur secutus locuntur
locutu3,· but with Lachmann 1 retain the uu, when the mss, offer it, in
order not to get lost on a sea of conjectural uncertainty like Wagner and
some others, The mss. of Lucretius are also very pertinacious in retaining
the genuine old forms reicit eicit or eiecit cet. and never offer-ing reiicit
eiicit and the like: Grai Graia, not Graii Graiis. But further details on
