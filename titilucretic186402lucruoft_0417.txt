BOOK VI 399

stated. '795 man. effla Ovid met. 111 39 Effluxere urnae manibus.
796 si od. ε see n. to 11 404. '79¹7 per artus here is simply per totum
corpus, or membra per artus=0mnia membra: see also n. to 11 271.
'799 lavabris is to labris, as lavatrina to latrina. 800 solio, which
properly means the seat in the bath on which the bather sat, here, as
often, seems to denote the whole. basin which held the hot water.
804 membra domus: Gronov. obs. 111 5 p. 467 quotes Cic. ad Q. frat. 111
1 1 nec habere poterat adiuncta cubicula et eiusmodi membra, and Pliny
epist. 11 17 9 dormitorium membrum: comp. also V 6 15 multa in hac
membra ,- atrium etiam ex more veterum. But as said in notes 1, the
reading is very very uncertain: I doubt whether I am right even in
adopting viri for vini 3 for Lach. is certainly wrong in saying that At
proves 116 has not passed to a new question: Lucr. like Cicero often
uses at to introduce a fresh illustration: see the many instances given
in n. to 1v 414 At conlectus. 805 mactabilis is another ἅπαξ λεγόμ.;
Lach. compares Attius 421 Zeto tabificabili. 810 Scaptensula is the
σκαπτῆ ὕλη of Macedonian Thrace: Lach. explains the strange Latin
form with much probability: the s he supposes to be like the s in silva,
and to represent an older form of the Greek ὕλη, always retained by the
inhabitants of the place 3 the n then in Latin merely marks the length-
ened vowel, as in thensaurus Termensium and the like: comp. too

⁵ Δ totiens toties, vicensimus vicesimus, and the numerous instances in which

the Greeks express the Latin -ens by -ης, shewing the pronunciation of
the former: Lach. then conjectures that the short u is due to the
Roman soldiers confounding the end of the word with one of their own
diminutiveS. Qualis cet. depends on Nonne vides of course. 815 [iis]
Quos: see n. to Ι 883. necessis is gen. of necesse: Lach. compares and
emends Donatus to Ter. eun. 998, and quotes from the senatus cons. de
bacchan. corp. inser. Lat. 1 196 4 necesus ese i. 6. necessus, the old gen.
for necessis. 817 prompta caeli: 1267 populi loca prompta.

818-829 ε 111 the same way these Avernian spots send up a poison-
ous steam, so that birds on coming across it are disabled and tumble
downj, and when they reach the sources of it, are quite killed.—He
dwells at such great length on these Averna because they illustrate so
many of his favour-ite first principles 3 the poet as usual having to give
place to the philosopher, when the two characters come into collision.
821 Quo=et eo, and connects impediatur with Ut of 820. 823 deri-
9it is neuter and ε derigit se: see n. to 111 502: Foro. quotes from the
auctor belli Hispaniensis 29 hinc diriyens prowima planities aequabatur 3
which is very similar to its use in Lucr.: that work too represents the
homely style of a contemporary of the poet: there is no more difference
in meaning between deriyo and diriyo thau between deminuo and dimi-
nuo: lv 609 viis derectis: Lucr. does not use the form diriqo: from
