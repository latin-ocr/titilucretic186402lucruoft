Festus p. 375 quotes this passage and one of Ennius as authority for
this form. 578 Every minute dies a man, Every minute one is bor-n.
Here too he has been content to sacrifice philosophical to poetical dis-
tinctness: what as an epicurean he means to say is that in the universe
of things death and destruction are evenly balanced by life and produc-
tion. Wishing to illustrate this doctrine, he has drawn his images from
the apparent equality that there is in our world, so long as things con-
tinue as they are. But he elsewhere teaches, as his system required
him to do, that our world came into being only yesterday, and sooner
01· later must be destroyed in an instant with all that is in it. What
becomes then of this balance‘l he no doubt felt that its ruins would go
to construet something else3 but that he has not said: see 75 foll„ and
notes there. This balance in the whole universe, says the epicurean
in Cic. de nat. deor. 1 50 ἰσονομίαν appellat Epicurus, id est aequabilem ,
ὑνίὂαιίοηεπι...εὐ, si quae interemant innumerabilia siut, eciam ea quae
conservent infinita esse debere.

581-599 : this you must carefully bear in mind ε the more powers
and properties anything possesses, the greater variety of elements it
contains: thus the earth has elements out of which 3663 and fountains
and fires, out of which erops and trees, rivers and pastures are sup-
plied3 it is therefore called mother of gods men and beasts alike.
581 obsiynatum: the force of the metaphor is obvious: the signing
and sealing a document is a proof of its importance. quoque would
certainly seem to belong rather to Illud than to obsiynatum3 as 216
Illud in his quoque te cet. where there is no doubt: see n. to V 192:
it might here be explained scaled, as well as written and deposited.

598 Quare cet: having more variety of first bodies in her, she has
greater powers of production 3 and therefore is preeminently styled the
mother of all living things, as from her alone comes the food which sus-
tains all.

eoo—660: her the old Greeks have personified as the great mother:
she rides in a chariot drawn by lions3 wears a mural crown, has Phry-
gian attendants, is accompanied with noisy music, receives on all hands
alms 3 her followers represent the Curetes who saved the young Jupiter
from his father: all which things are an allegory with some moral signi-
ficance 3 but beautiful as they are, they are mere fancies 3 the blessed
and immortal gods trouble themselves not about men: as you 6611 the
