of its place, and a single example must not be introduced by conjecture.
Perhaps Suevit ie. insequi: comp. v 36 adit...audet i.e. adire.

183 sibi Wak. rightly for si. 198 spicarumque mss. Bern. has seen
that in the letters MQUE the verb MOUERE lurks: in 236 mss. multam-
queri for multa moveri. He reads cauru’ movere: but whence comes
the spi .· I have therefore written ipse euru’ movere. spiritus acer Lach.
But the sentence requires a verb. The spiclorum and the like of the
older editors are absurd. conlectum Muretus for coniectum which Lamb.
approves of 111 his notes and Lach. rightly adopts. 203 est added after

Lach. I now think without reason.

234 cui non sit miaetus et aer. cui miaetus non siet aer Lach. who,
as has been already said, will not tolerate et for etiasm. 236 multa
moveri A corr. Nic. N icc. and all before Lamb. for multamqueri: comp.
183. multa cieri Lamb. wrongly after Turnebus. 239 240 6 most
doubtful passage: 239 res Ed. after Bern. for mens, 240 it seems to me
certain that quaedam· has come here from the quaedam of 241, and as
what the poet wrote must be uncertain, I have written et homo quae for
quaedam que. Lach. 239 reads quem for mens, 240 quaedam vis menti',
just retaining the word he ought not and making a most awkward
construction. Bern. strangely reads in 240 quidam quod manticulatur.
Is. Voss. in ms. notes ‘legendum videtur qui dant quae mente volutes.’
239 Ι retain recepit with AB: comp. n. to 11 1125 Accedere: Virgil’s
and other old mss. retain many traces of this e, intermediate between
the a of the simple verb and the later i. 244 e parvis et levibus est
elementis Wak. in notes for e p. et l. eac elem. and justly: comp. VI 330:
in his text he follows 061111). est p. et l. ex el. which may be right. et
p. etl. ea: l. Lach. e parvis aut l. eoe el. J unt. Lamb. etc. 249 is first
rightly given by Avanc. in the notes at the end of his Catullus 1502:
AB have Concutitur tum sanquis viscera persenti-siunt.- Flor. 31 Camb.
3 Vat, give persentiscunt.- this unrhythmical order of the first words ap-
pears in the J unt. and in the text even of Lamb. ed. 1 ; 111 ed. 2 and 3
and notes of 1 116 reads Tum quatitur sanquis, tum: Nic. Nicc. misled
by persentisiunt strangely gave Concutitur tum sanquis per sentes viscera
iunt,· and hence Ver. and Ven. vint for iunt,· out of which Avanc. in
Ald. 1 ingeniously devised Concubitur sanquis per venas, viscera vivunt
Omnia, but he afterwards learnt better. 254 ut added by Lamb. 25¹7
retinere valemus A corr. Nic. N icc, all before Lach. most properly for
retinemus valemus: 116 reads absurdly retinemu' valentes, as if we could not
be in life without being in health. ·

266 viscere Β. visere A and clearly Ms. of Poggio, as Nic. Nicc. and
all late mss. and early editors so read, even J unt. but not Avanc.: yet
to Wak. viscere is ‘ sordidum et ineptum'! 288 etenim Faber in emend.
and Lach. for etiam: a necessary change. Lach. rightly follows Bentl.
in joining in ira with Cum fervescit. 289 acribus Lamb. ed. 2 and 3 for
acrius. 290 et. ea Lach. intolerant of et for etiam. 293 qui fit Ald. 1
Junt. for fit qui. 298 is placed by Lach. before 296 without cause. 303
