in the Herculanean volumeS. How much Lucretius was indebted to
this larger work may be gathered from the letters of Epicurus preserved
in the tenth book of Diogenes Laertius which give a brief epitome of his
system and have been so largely used in this commentary. The poet’s
veneration for his teacher would constrain him to borrow from him his
matter3 his manner and style are altogether different. To Lucretius
the truth of his philosophy was all-important: to this the graces of his
poetry were made altogether subordinate. To us on the other hand the
truth or falsehood of his system is of exceedingly little concern except in
so far as it is thereby rendered a better or worse vehicle for conveying
the beauties of his language and the graces of his poetical conceptions.
Is then the epicurean system well or ill adapted to these purposes?
As a poet can scarcely be the inventor of a new system of philosophy,
Lucretius could hardly help adopting some one of those which were then
in vogue 3 if not the epicurean, then the academical or peripatetica] or
stoical. To construet a poem out of either of the first two with its
barren logomachies, wire-drawn distinctions without a difference, would
have truly been to twist a rope out of sand: of course I am speaking of
these two systems as they were in the days of Cicero and Lucretius.
Well then the stoical? Ι unhesitatingly assert that for all purposes of
poetry both its physical and ethical doctrines are incomparably inferior
to those of Epicurus, Read the de natura deorum3 compare their one
wretched world, their monotonous fire, their rotund and rotatory god,
their method of destroying and creating anew their world, with the
system of nature unfolded by Lucretius, grand and majestical at least
in its general outline. Then look at their sterile wisdom and still more
barren virtue with their repudiation of all that constitutes the soul
of poetry. Lucretius on the other hand can preach up virtue and tem-
perance and wisdom and sober reason with as loud a voice as any of
your stoics 3 and then what inexhaustible resources does he leave himself
in his alma Venus and dux vitae dia voluptas ! Are examples wanted?
then contrast the varied grace and exuberant beauty of Vix-gil, when he
is pleased to assume the garb of an epicurean, with the leaden dulness
and tedicus obscurity of the stoic Manilius 3 or compare the rich humour
and winning ways and ease of a Horace with the hardness and thinness
and forced wit of a Persius. All this it may be said is in the men, not
their systems. YeS, but the proper choice of a subject is half the battle.
And yet the picturesque English historian speaks of the epicurean as
the meanest and silliest of all systems3 and one German critic after
another sees fit to denounce it as beneath contempt. In this as in many
other points the poet has received more justice at the hands of his latest
English critic. Lessing in his essay to prove that Pope because a poet
could not be a metaphysician says ‘ if Ι am asked whether I know
