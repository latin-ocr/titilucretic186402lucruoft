soul is immortal and passes into different bodies, why do not dogs and
81088, hawks and doves, men and beasts exchange dispositions‘t they say
the 1111111011οΙ 80111 changes with the change of body: false ; for what
changes is broken up, and therefore dies: if it be urged, a human soul
always passes into a human body, a horse’s into a horse, why then is not
the child as wisc as the man, the foal as the 1101802 1110 mind grows
young in the young body you say: then is it mortal, since it thus loses
its former properties: or how can the soul come to maturity with the
body, unless its partner from the beginning? or why does it seek to quit
the aged body? it need not fear its ruin ς for an immortal runs no risk.
'741 triste leo. Seni: Virg. geor. 11 151 saeva leonum Semina. leonum
Seminium, 746 suo...semine seminioque, IV 1005 quo quaeque maqis sunt
aspera seminiorum: in all seminium has the same meaning, the racc
breed stock 01 80οᾶ collectively to which a creature belongs 3 therefore
leonum seminium is not the young of lions, but the breed or race 130
which lions belong: comp. 1v 998 catulorum blanda propa903 1232
virum suboles and 11. 111010 3 and Virg. geor. 111 101 prolemque paren-
tum and the like. '746 semine seminioque, thus joined for 13110 sake of
the much loved assonance3 as 753 sera saecla serarum: 800 n. to 1 826.
'750 Hyrcano: Cic. Tusc. disp. 1 108 nobile autem qenus canum illud
scimus esse [in Hyrcania} '754 quod aiunt: see n. to 1 1053: Lach-
mann’s stopping seems to 1110 wrong: the infinitive clause may to be
sure be said 10 be repeated with quod aiunt, as l. 1. with quod dicunt.

'756 comp. ’ἴ 01 Quod permanat enim dissolvitur, interit erqo. '756
—759 18 but another way of expressing his favourite formula, Nam
quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit 001. 759 Denique has here

the force which it has in some of the instances given by Hand Tursell.
11 p. 266 11 1, as Ter. Phorm. 325 Vereor ne istaec fortitudo in nervom
erumpat denique. '7 62 prudens: Cic. de sen. 20 temeritas est videlicet
florentis aetatis, prudentia senescentis: prudens is the φρόνιμος of Aris-
totle: see eth. N icom. vl 9. ¹764 Nec tam doctus cet. 18 added be-
cause 7 60 animas hominum in corpora semper Ire Itwmana implies
animas equorum ire in corpora equina. fortis equi vis: see 8. '765
tenerascere: the mss. of Pliny and Celsus appear to give the form tene-
rescO. '766 Confuyient with the infin. seems a most unusual con-
struction: confuqient [ad eam sententiam] tenerascere cet. si iam fit:
see 11. 10 1 968. ¹7 69 ⁴Quove modo poterit =quaeram praeterea quo

modo possit. '7'70 almost the same as v 847. '7¹72 membris...
senectis: V 886 and 896 aetate senecta: senecto corpore is found in Sal- ·

11181, and senecta aetate in him and Plautus: Mommsen 111801. 108111
Neapol. 3833 Sed · cum · te · decuit - florere · aetate · iuenta · Interieisti ·
et·liquisti in maeroribus-matrem· : senecta and iuventa therefore must

be originally adjectives: Lach. p. 44 quotes from Varro senescendomn
