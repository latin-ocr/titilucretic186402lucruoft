Concelebrare seems to have the sense it has in Cic. de inv. 1 4 mihi
videntwr postea cetera studia recta atque honesta, per otium concelebrata
ab optimis, enituisse: see also n. to 1 4 Concelebras: the sense of often
practising or resorting to a thing readily comes from its primary sense.
1383 cicutas: Virg. ecl. 11 36 disparibus septem compacta cicutis Fis-
tula. 1386 nemora, silvas, saltus: 866 n. to 41. 1387 otia dia:
the meaning of dia here is not easy to determine: see n. to 1 22 dias in
lum. orast does it denote that strange preternatural silence and repose,
which you find for instance at the present time in passing on a fine day
over the higher table-lands of Arcadia, so eminently now as always loca
pastorum deserta? or is it otia sub divo, if indeed dia can bear that
meaning? dia may indeed have much the same meaning as divinus in
Aen. 111 442 Divinosque lacus, Prop. 1 18 27 divini fontes. 1391
Cum sat. cibi i. e. ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἔντυε nam tum, for then,
and not till then, they have leisure to think of mental pleasures. 1392
-1396 = 11 29—33‚ with slight changes. 1394 habebant, 11 31 curant:
Plaut. capt. 314 Is, uti tu me hic habueris, proinde illum illi curaverit.
1399 plexis cet.: Catul. LXIV 283 Hos [fiores] indistinctis plexos tulit
ipse corollis, with another constr.: comp. the various ways in which
circumflatus and so many similar words are used in Latin. 1401
extra numerum, the opposite of in numerum, is found in Cicero: parad„
111 26 histrio si paulum se movit' extra numerum: see n. to 11 631 and
636 in numerum. 1402 terram cet.: Hor. od. 111 18 15 Gaudet invi-
sam pepulisse fossor Ter pede terram. 1405 viqilantibus, whether be·
cause they could not go to sleep or because they were obliged to watch.
solacia somni: Lach. well compares Aeschylus' ὕπνου ἀντίμολπον ἄκος-3
but as somnus here=somnus neqatus anyhow, I am not sure that the
somno of mss. will not stand 3 but the judgment of Lamb. and Lach. on
such a point when they agree is very weighty. 1406 Ducere, flectere
appear to be technical terms: Ov. amores 11 4 25 Haec quia dulce canit
flectitque facillima vocem3 Pliny XVI 171 speaking of tibiae says apertiori-
bus earum linqulis ad flectendos sonos. 1407 comp. 1v 588 Unco saepe
labro calamos percurrit hiantis. 1408 viyiles must be official watch-
men, whether of ‘the camp or the town. 1414 Wak. gives us the
choice of two constructions: illa melior res posterior reperta perdit sen-
sus, which he prefers3 and, posterior res melior perdit illa reperta 3 but

there is a third course open to us, posterior res melior reperta perdit γ

illa [priora]; and that I doubt not is what Lucr. meant: he is suffi-
ciently indifferent to such ambiguities3 comp. 1382 Et zephyri, cava per
calamorum, sibila3 and two lines belom illa relicta Strata cubilia sunt
herbis, and 1418 vestis coming between Pellis and ferinae, and 1v 193

parvola [nent] causa: in all these cases we are left to the sense alone
to guide US. 1421 Et tamen, and after all when they had killed the
