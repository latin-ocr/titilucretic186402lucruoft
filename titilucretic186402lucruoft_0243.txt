employs it some six times 3 113 18 found in Plautus, and is not unknown
to Cicero: see Madvig de fin. p. 655. The suos meatus are opposed
to the leti motam of next v. 960 qua re seems to be emphatic here
and to mean 111 what way, if not in this 3 Ι have therefore printed it in
two words: comp. Ter. eun. 369 Quid si nunc tute fortunatus fias?
qua re, Parmeno?...capias tu illius vestem: Lucr. means then it is the
remaining vital motions which give back sense and life to the 616-
111611138 which os themselves have no sense. Zeti limine: a metaphor
which he repeats VI 1157 and 1208: comp. too 111 681 vitae cum limen
inimus: culeae 221 cum te Resticui superis leti iam limine ab ipso. 961

metaphor 111 1042 obit decurso lumine vitae3 IV 1196 spatium decurrere
amoris: same metaphor and constr. Cio. Tusc. 1 15 nunc video calcem,

abire, a studied assonance: see 11. to Ι 826; abire a well known euphe-
mism for abire e vita: Petron. sat. 42 abiit ad plures: Lucr. more
than once uses ire almost in this sense: obire is really similar.

*nings themselves can feel neither pleasure 1101· 116111, 811166 they are not
formed of other first-beginnings‚ whose motions 6611 be disturbed so as
to give them pain, or rearranged so as to give them pleasure. 963
Praeterea: Lach. has a most obscure note: the only thing it clearly
shews is that he quite fails to apprehend the poet's meaning, when he
reads here Propterea. dolor, and therefore 8611863 116111 111 any thing
that has sense is only a disordering of its elements. 966 voluptas,
and therefore sense. 967 Scire cet. therefore pleasure and pain being
but the right or wrong ordering of elements, the clemente themselves
which are each one and indivisible‚ are formed of no 616111611138 which can
be moved, so as to give pleasure or 1161113 and therefore they have 110

whole passage 18 to me quite incomprehensible: he must have quite
misunderstood both sense and construction here. 970 quorum cet.
