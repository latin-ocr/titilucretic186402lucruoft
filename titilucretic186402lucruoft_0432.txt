414 No'rsss 11

ὂν φέροιεν οἶπῄεσανε the meaning of these words is given with similar
’ embellishment in the vss. 1247 —1251 which we are now considering.
As the end of the poem is in an unfinished state, and as these vss. as
well as 1225 are clearly out of place having no connexion either of
sense or grammar with the context, is it not probable that they, like so
many others, are incomplete sketches and marginal additions of the
poet’s‚ which he intended, but did not live, to embody with the rest of
the poem, and which his editors, not knowing what else to do, put into
their present place, almost it may be at hap-hazard‘l Lachmann’s treat-
ment of these vss. is highly unsatisfactory: cernebant is a violent change ;
and the lacrimis lassi luctuque redibant he refers to these lookers on who
had sdmething else to do in attending on their sick 3 not to those who
had struggled to bury their dead, though that must be their meaning:
nay it seems to me almost cert-ain that the poet means by these words
to express the ἀπῄεσαν of Thuc. 1.1. . 1247 Inque aliis alium has at
present nothing to govern it, perhaps never had5 for the poet may
never have completed the sentence. populum suorum: besides Ovid

1252—1286: the country-people fiocked into the town and increased
the misery: all public places, even the temples, were crowded with the
dead and dying x religion and all the decencies of burial were neglected.
