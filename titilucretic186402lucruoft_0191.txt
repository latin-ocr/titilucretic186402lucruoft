836 pauxillis, minutis, to express what Anaxagoras taught were infinite
in smallness. 837 vis-cue, viscera, occur very often in Lucr. and al-
ways I believe denote the whole of the flesh and soft substance between
the skin and bones. sanyuen neut.: see Lach. 839 auri: see notes

this illustration 3 which no doubt comes from Anaxagoras himself.

atoms can have no secondary qualities: again frag. 16 Anaxagoras says

ὁμοιομερῆ with the food‘l then the body consists of what is not ὁμοιο-
μερές with it: or if you say that every kind of food has in it whatever
the body has, bones veins blood, then will meat and drink consist of
particles not ὁμοιομερῆ with them: again the poet’s own premisses as-
sumed. 863 omnino, to complete the list, go through all the parts

similar dilemma, which the lost vss. render obscure: trees and the like
grow out of the earth, therefore the earth consists not of ὁμοιομερῆ, but
of minute trees and the like: flame smoke ash are latent in wood 3 there÷
fore wood consists of minute flames etc. not of ὁμοιομερῆ; again trees
when above ground are fed out of the earth: if the earth consists of
ὁμοιομερῆ, then trees are fed and increased by things not ὁμοιομερῆ 3 and
