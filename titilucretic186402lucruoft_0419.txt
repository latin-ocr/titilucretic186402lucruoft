fountain [Arethusa] at the distance of about 200 yards a large subma-
rine stream of fresh water rises in the sea, of >which the Arethusa itself
is apparently 3 branch’: Sir E. Tennent describes similar springs in
Oeylon. 894 intervomit appears not to be found elsewhere. 901 the

906—916: to discuss now the magnet, a stone which has the power
of attracting iron, and communicating this power to a series of pieces of
iron. 908 Magmeca: Plato Ion p. 533 D ἐν τῇ λίθῳ ἣν Εὐριπίδης

Lucr. that Lamb. thinks he had Plato before 111111. 916 permananter
appears to be a ἅπαξ λεγόμ. Plato l. l. ὥστ’ ἐνίοτε ὁρμαθὸς μακρὸς πάνυ
σιδήρων καὶ δακτυλίων ἐξ ἀλλήλων ἤρτηται· πᾶσι δὲ τούτοις ἐξ ἐκείνης τῆς

917—920: but many points have to be cleared up, before we come
to the actual question. 917 multa cet.: he dwells 011 the magnet at
what appears so disproportionate 3 length, because the phenomena seem
to him to illustrate so many of his favourite first principles. The elabo-
rate criticism in Galen de nat. facult. 1 14 of Epicurus’ theory of the
magnet, extending over many pages, proves that the latter must have
dwelt on the subject at as great length as Lucr. does, and that he
explained the phenomena in 3 similar manner. 919 lon. amb: 1081

921-9352 we have said already that particles 316 constantly stream-
ing from all things, which affect in various ways all the senses. 923
-935 316 with scarcely any difference a repetition of 1v 217—229.

936—958: let me repeat that all things in being are of rare and
porous bodies, 30 that particles can and do pass through them in all
directions: this is proved by the whole of nature. 936 rep. Comm.:
