treated of the present question: if then a visible thing has an angular
form, the τὸ ἐν αἰσθήσει ἐλάχιστον 01· cacumen seems to be the apex of
the angle, which before it vanishes, appears to sense to be without parts
and the least conceivable, and not to belong to what is on one side more
than to what is on its other side: if again the form be spherical, the
cacumen would seem to be the outermost snrface edge at any point, and
so with other shapes. The same analogy Epicurus and Lucr. hold to
exist in the extremely small, but yet extended atom: there seemed to
them no reason why a cacumen or minima pars should part off to one
side more than the other, and therefore it would remain 111 the atom in
eternal equipoise. Epicurus in his intricate prose might have dwelt on
this more fully than Lucr. could do in his verse: the poet therefore
seems tacitly to assume it and to pass in ‘medias re83 and he was right
in so doing. In the visible thing however the cacumen seems to be 0
minimum, in the atom it is a minimum, so small that nothing can be
smaller and exist. From 11 483 foll. it would appear that three of these
minimae partes or cacumina were the fewest that could exist in an atom‚
601 id, the cacumen of course: it has no parts, but is itself one of the
parts of the atom‚ having no conceivable existence apart from the atom.
602 minima: in Lucr. this word, when it has a physical meaning, ap-
pears always to be, like Epicurus' ἐλάχιστον, a technical term for the
smallest thing that can exist, or the smallest effect that can 110 pro-
duced3 and in this sense occurs ten or eleven times in the poem: so

that the atom is single and impenetrable. 611 not like res, formed
from a union of such parts, but of everlasting singleness, because its
parts cannot exist out of the atom. 612 Sed ma9i8=potiusz so 11 97,

refrain from quoting out of many the following sentences of a great phi-
losopher, Henry More: immortality of the soul, preface 3 ‘ I have taken
the boldness to assert that matter consists of parts indiscerpible, under-
standing by indiscerpible parts particles that have indeed real extension,
but so little that they cannot have less and be anything at all, and
therefore cannot be actually divided :...the parts that constitute an in-·
discerpible particle are real, but divisible only intellectually‚ it being of
