to look upon in terris as a pleonasm natural in an old writer. 631

639-6462 now to explain the eruptions of Aetna, one of which
struck neighbouring nations with such fear and awe. 639 fauces:
702 he says that fauces and ora are the proper Latin terms for craters.
642 dominata ε dominantur, dominatus, dominantior he has already ap-
plied in this book to the power of lightning. 646 moliretur: Cic.
de nat. deor. 11 59 nec ea quae ayunt molientium [deorum] cum labore
operoso ac molesto. Cicero 1.1. 96 thus describes an eruption, nos au-
tem tenebras coqitcmus tantas quantas quondam eruptione Aetnaeorum
iqnium finitimas reqiones obscuravisse dicuntur, ut per biduum nemo
hominem homo aynosceret cet. : what the eruption is or whether it is
the same to which the two allude, I do not know.

647-67 9 ε to understand such eruptions, reflect that our world is a
smaller fraction of the universe than a man is of the whole world t now
we are not surprised when a man is seized with any one of numerous
diseases, the seeds of which our world supplies ε why then wonder that
out of the universe should rise up the seeds of these or any other great
natural convulsions‘l if you say the conflagration is here too great to
comprehend, I reply that its rarity only makes it so appear, as we are
creatures of habit, and wonder at what is strange and cease to wonder
at what is common. 649 summam rerum has here its proper force:
see n. to 1 1008. profundam: see n. to IV 63. 651 multesima pars
is quoted by Nonius p. 136, as ‘nove posita’: Lucr. has formed it on
the analogy of millesimus, with the sense of πολλοστός. 652 tota
pars, quota is found in Manil. 111 420: totus is a very rare word having
the same relation to quotus, that totiens has to quotiens. 653 con-
tueare means perhaps the act of examining, and videas the seeing and
understanding which thence results 3 otherwise the phrase would be very
tautological. 660 comp. 1167 ut est per membra sacer dum didit-ur
