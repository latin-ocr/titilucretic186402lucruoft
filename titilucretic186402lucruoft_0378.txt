1011—102'7 : next the use of huts and skins and fire softened their
bodieS, marriage and the ties of family their tempers : then neighbours
made treaties of friendship and alliance‚ which mostly they observed,
though not always. 1013 Conubium: 666 n. to 111 776. 1015
alsia: the comparative alsius is found in Cicero, alsiosus in Varro and

16 inculcated again and again by Epic. in Diog. Laer. x 150 τό τῆς
φύσεως δίκαιόν ἐστι σύμβολον τοῦ σἾιμ-φέροντος εἰς τό μή βλάπτειν ἀλλήλους
μηδὲ βλάπτεσθαι. ὅσα τῶν ζῴων μὴ ἠδύνατο συνθήκας ποιεῖσθαι τσῖς ὑπὲρ
τοῦ μή βλάπτειν ἄλληλα μηδὲ βλάπτεσθαι, πρὸς ταῦτα οὐθέν ε’στιν οὔτε
δίκαιον οὔτ’ ἄδικον. ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν ὅσα μὴ ἦδύνατοῆ μή ἐβού-
λετο τάς συνθήκας ποιεῖσθαι ‘rtis ὑπὲρ τοῦ μή βλάπτειν μηδὲ βλάπτεσθαι
κ.τ.λ. Lucr. presents only the fair side of the theory: the speaker in
Plato de rep. 11 2 gives 6116161161· explanation than Epicurus does why
men think λυσιτελεῖν ξυνθέσθαι ἀλλήλοις μήτ’ οἷδικεῖν μήτ’ ἀδικεῖσθαι.

1028—1090 : nature and need prompted men to the use of speech3
for all creatures feel their natural powers: the calf will butt before his
horns protrude 3 and so with other beasts birds etc. ε 11 16 absurd 10 sup--
pose that 0116 111611 could have invented speech; sor how could 116 111111-
self know what he wanted 10 166011, 01· persuade others 10 1661111 and
why should not man take 10 applying different sounds to denote dif-
ferent things, when brute 1166616 1166 different cries 10 express different

0166111166.- Η6 now comes to the question ‘quaeri solitum' says Gel-
lius X 4 ‘aput philosophos φύσει τοὶ ὀνόματα 61111 ἢ θέσει.’ Epic. himself
in Diog. Lacr. X 75 says τᾶ. ὀνόματα ἐξ ἀρχῆς μή θέσει γενέσθαι, ἀλλ’
αὖτοὶς τοὶς φύσεις τῶν ἀνθρώπων καθ’ ἕκαστα ἔθνη ἴδια πασχούσας πάθη καὶ
ἴδια λαμβανούσας φαντάσματα ἰδίως τόν ἀέρα ἐκπέμπειν κ.τ.λ. Plato in
the Cratylus appears 10 agree pretty nearly with Epicurus and Lucr. as

gulus: Gellius 1.1. nomina verbaque non positu fortuito, sed quadam vi
et ratione naturae facta esse P. N iqidius in yrammaticis commentariis
docet, rem sane in philosophiae dissertationibus celebrem. Democritus
and Aristotle seem to have held the contrary view. 1029 utic. empr.:
