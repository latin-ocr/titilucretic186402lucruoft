says ‘modulatius animos leges’. But 1v 7 animum Lamb. animos
Oreech. 942 pacto N. Heius. in ms. notes and Lach. rightly for facto.

954 Necne sic Lamb. for nec sic. 957 vasteque Nic. N icc. corrupted
into adusque ‚· his followers adusque into vel adusque ,· or, as Ald. J unt.

marg. F lor. 32, patefiat acl usque. 971 I cl validis Lamb. first for Inva-
liciis. Flor. 32 in margin explains invalidis as valde validis. 977 offici-at
Lamb. rightly and before him Gryphius Lyons 1534 and 1540 for efficiat,-
after the constant usage of Lucr. 984—98'7 (998-1001) Ι have else-
where proved should come in this place.

991 (987) confluxet Flor. 31 first for confluxit. 997 (993) nullast
Politian in marg. Flor. 29 Ver. Ven. Heius. in ms. notes for nullas.
1000 (996) e supplied by Lach. is better than in of older editors. inferna
is quite right: see Camb. J ourn. of phil. 1 p. 33. Lach. Wrongly follows

Ald. l J unt. Lamb. etc. in reading aeternaque and adds ‘rei convenien- Δ

ter, quamvis secus videatur Wakefieldo et Forbigero, qui quotiens philo-
sophantur delirant’: an insult quite out of place here.

‚10082 a new paragraph should commence with this verse. 1009
inani Ald. 1 J unt. for inane. 1013 Madvig opusc. pr. p. 313 rightly
supposes some verses lost here3 and long before him Marullus did the
same, as I find from the margin of F lor. 32 ι ‘credit Marullus deesse
hic aliqua carmina, quae continerent transitum ab infinitate inanis ad
infinitatem corporum ; in his enim Nec mare nec tellus...procul dubio
agit de infinitate corporum, cum supra [953] de utroque infinito se dic-
turum promiserit’. Lach. places the mark of hiatus after 1012, giving
a most involved explanation of the passage. His arrangement moreover
is scarcely grammatical, as pateat is thus answered in the apodosis by
imperfects and pluperfects. Indeed the lacuna does not appear to me
so great as it did either to Madvig or Lach. The poet has not only
shewn already that the omne quocl esc, but also 988 (984)-1007, that the
omne quod est spatium is infinite. He now, 1008 etc, shews that matter
is infinite. I formerly proposed roughly to supply' what is wanting
thus, Sed spatium supra docui sine fine patere. Si finita iyitu‘r summa
esset materiai, N ec lmare cet. 1023 The last four words are rightly sup-
plied by J unt. from V 4213 the mss. here repeat the last three of 1022.
Avancius blunders sadly, doubtless from not understanding what he is
taking from others. 1028 rerum Faber and Bentl. from v 194 most
rightly for rebus. 1033 summissaque J unt. ,for summaque. 1034 Floreat
Flor. 31 Oamb. etc. forfloreant. 1041 viai B corr. and vulgo for via.
viaque Lach. But ‘ratione viaque surely means ‘by method and sys-
tem': see Cic. de fin. 1 29 ut ratione et via procedat oracio. 1047
principiis J unt. for principium.

1061 Ec simili. Lach. reads Adsimili and joins with it the preceding

verse, putting a sull stop at posta. I think him quite wrong: the simile ‘

is exactly the same as 1v 418, where also Lach. makes unnecessary
changes 1068—1075: these 8 mutilated verses came at the begin-
ning of p. 45 of the archetype 3 and the ends were therefore at the out-er
margin. B and Gott. omit them altogether, but append a cross and
V111. Nic. Nicc. gives them imperfect as in A. The. later ms. Ald. 1
J unt. Lamb. complete them in various ways. I formerly suggested in
1068 error falsa probavit or error somnia finxit: 1069 perversa rem
