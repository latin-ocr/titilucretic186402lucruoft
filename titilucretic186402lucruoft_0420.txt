occurs elsewhere, at least in this sense, though the verb is not 111100111-
111011. 954 Galli lorica: Lach. cites Varro de ling. Lat. v 116

lorica, quod e loris de corio crudo faciebant. postea subsidit Galli e fer-ro
sub id vocabulum, ex anulis, fere iam tunica. 955 1. 0. terra coortae
in caelum facessunt, caelo coortae in terram. 956 iura facessunt,

‘work their will’, would suit just as well, if the mss. did not support iure 3
for both these senses of facessunt are equally common. 957 extrin-
secus ins: this and the two preceding vss. are illustrated and confirmed
by 1098 Atque ea vis omnis morborum pestilitasque Aut extrinsecus ut
nubes nebulaeque superne Per eaelum veniunt aut cet.: in these tempes-
tates are the nubes nebulaeque which bring the morbida vis: comp. too
1119—1124‚ and 1141 foll.

959—978: again particles emitted from bodies act very differently
on different things: fire hardens one thing melts another 3 and so does
water: what is pleasant to one creature is hateful to another. 962
facit are, like 1v 28 ordia prima, seems to pass the bounds of lawful
licence. 965 posta: 111 871 posto, 857 and 1 1059 posta 3 VI 999
praeposta: he also has impostus dispostus and oppostus, as well as repos-
tus which the metre requires, 968 condurat seems not to be found
elsewhere. ab iqni: ab has the same force as in primus, secundus,
quartus ab and the like: Ovid ex Ponto lv 5 26 a maqnis hune colit
itte deis 3 Stat. sil. 1 2 147 Diqna deae sedes, nitidis nee sordet ab astri&

Hand Turs. p. 45 gives many examples, as Cic. ad Att. 1 5 4 ut primum Υ

a tuo d‘e‘qressu Romam veni: comp. too Prop. IV (111) 1 23 Omnia post
obitum finqit maiora vetustas: stlaius ab exequiis nomen in ora venit3
which Ovid imitates trist. IV 10 121 vivo sublime dedisti Nomen, ab

exequiis quod dare fama solet. 971 comp. Odyss. 1 359 Ἀλλὰ τόδ’

ἀμβροσίης καὶ νέκταρός ἐστιν ἀπορρώξ. ambr. linctus: Aristoph. peace
ἀμβροσίαν λείχειν. 973 amarae: see 11. to 11 847: Gellius praef. 19
vetus adaqium est, nihil cum fidibus yraculo, nihil cum amaracino sui:
is it a fact that perfumes poison swine‚ or did the proverb suggest the
notion'l 977 videtur, φαίνεται ὧν, not εἶνωε so 756.

979—997: once more, the pores of things differ, as well as the par-
ticles which things emit 3 so that by different kinds of pores the different
senses receive each its own object: thus too one thing will pass through
a metal, another through wood, and so on 3 and one thing will pass more

quickly than another through the same pore or opening. 986 alio
i. e. in alium sensum: 11 683 Nidor enim penetrat qua flocus non it in
artus, Fucus item sorsum, sorsum sapor insinuatur Sensibus. 991
liqnis, ArqentO, vitro :per ligna, cet. : ‘liques de resina lignis manante
accipiendum' Lach.: to me it seems to be used more generally. 994
transmittere is neuter. 996 ante, i. e. 981 foll.

998--1041 : and now we can easily explain 1110 magnet's attraction:
