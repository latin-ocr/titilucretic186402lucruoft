his day he was a good and well-read Latin scholar, and had studied
Priscian Nonius and Macrobius for the illustration of his author. Aldus
in his prefatory letter to Albertus Pius confirms 151115, and says that he
knew Lucretius by heart, ‘ut digitos unguesque suos'. Avancius in his
preface assei-ts much the same 3 and the few critical remarks 116 1511616 111561155,
shew that this was true at least to a certain extent. At the same time
he admits with a seeming candour that owing to the immense difficulty
of the work 116 has left much for others to do, Much indeed he has left
undone 3 and it would have been a herculean task for one man fully to
correct the desperately corrupt Venice edition, especially in those days
when there were but few extraneous aids and the art of systematic criti-
cism was yet in its infancy, two generations having yet to elapse, before
it reached its full growth in the hands of the illustrious school of French
critics. What he has done however is very great and entitles him to
high praise, if it is indeed his own. But this shall be considered pre-
sently. The next edition is that of the well-known scholar Ioannes
Baptista Pius, published 1511 ‘kal. Maii' in his native Bologna. Lu-
cretius’ text 15 embedded in an enormous commentary which displays
amid much cumbrous learning no slight acquaintance with the Latin
1106155, several of which he edited before and after his Lucretius. He
thus describes what he has done: ‘contulimus non sine aerumnis vigiliis-
que diutinis codicem veneti Hermolai: et Pomponi romani: codicemque
non omnino malum: qui servatur Mantuae in bibliotheca quadam sub·
urbana: qui fuit viri non indocti gentis clarissimae Strotiorum. non de-
fuit Philippi Beroaldi praeceptoris quondam mei: nunc collegae z impressus
quidem: sed tamen perpense examinatus. Codri quoque grammatici
Bononiensis: cuius copia mihi per Bartholomeum Blanchinum virum
eloquii excultissimi facta est z Marullique poetae industria mira castigatum
non defuit exemplar Severo Monaco Placentino graece latineque perdocto
musarum athleta non gravatim offerente'. He makes no mention at all
of the man to whom he was most indebted, Avancius 3 for his text is a
reprint of the first Aldine, with however not a few changes of words or
phrases, often for the better, often sor the worse, either inserted in the
text or proposed in the notes, and derived it may be presumed in many
cases from one or other of the sources just mentioned. But strange to
say when he makes a change in the text, the lemma of his note nearly
always contains not this reading, but that of Avancius as if he had
meant it to stand: thus 1 9 116 rightly reads diffuso lumine‚· but his
lemma has dzffuso numine with Avancius, which the latter however cor-
rects at the end of his Catullus: and he adds '‘ sunt qui legunt lumine '.
15 for capta he Wrongly inserts in the text quodque; but his lemma has
capta, and his note rightly explains the construction, and makes no men-
tlon of quodque. 34 his text properly has Reiecit, his lemma Refficit
after Avancius 3 35 1115 text Wrongly gives suspirans, the lemma suspi-
ozena·- and so throughout the poem. This very singular circumstance I
explain 111 151115 way: he was living at Rome when his edition was printed
and seems ‘to have sent the text and commentary separately3 for the
bookseller prints at the end a long page of errors with this notice pre-
fixed, ‘ Hieronymus Platonicus Bononiensis bibliopola ad lectorem. con·
