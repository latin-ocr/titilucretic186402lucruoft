tum. '763 offecti: see n. to 11 156 Officiuntur. '765 meminisse =

elsewhere with this constr. mortis letique, another curicus tauto-

logy: comp. 274 duplici yeminoque, 451 Bina yeminare. potitum, said
of meeting with an evil, is illustrated by Forc. from Plautus Attius
Terence and others. ¹7 '71 perit: see 11. to 111 1042: this ingenious
explanation resembles that given above 318—323 of the movements of
an image in a mirror. 7¹72 Inde statu: above Unde scias 3 below
Libera sponte 3 superbia spurcitia 3 even three consonants mollia strata,
manantibus stillent3 nay four pendentibus structas. '7¹75 sensibili
quovis tempore in uno is Epicurus' ἐν αἰσθητῷ χρόνῳι see 11. to 795
where the passage is quoted and illustrated: 795 is a paraphrase of the
one word sensibili.

777—817: this question offers many difficulties: why does a man
think of whatever he wishes to think, sea or earth or sky‘l while others
in the same place have quite other thoughts: why too in sleep are these
images seen to move rhythmically‘l are they forsooth trained by art‘l or
is it that in the least sensible time many times are latent, in which
many images can appear? the mind again, like the eye, in order to see
must often attend and exert itself, else they will pass unheeded: again
the mind adds many false infel-ences to what is seen. 818 foll. are
immediately connected with the passage ending at 776 3 and our present
paragraph discusses the same questions as that passage sometimes in the
same, sometimes in a different spirit, without the least reference to it.
Lach. is therefore incontestably right in including this among those sub-
sequent additions which Lucr. made to his poem, but did not live to
incorporate fully with the rest. The poet is evidently embarrassed by
the prodigious difficulties which this theory of mental apprehension in-
volves and struggles hard to solve them: not content with the preceding
paragraph, he has tried to better his argument in this one. '7¹79 quod
depends on coyita‘re understood from coyitet: cogitet id ipsum, quod
cogitare libuerit. ‘haec quaestio’ says Lamb. ‘ quare quod cuique li-
buerit, id cogitet, cum cogitatio simulacris excitetur, pendet ex superiore
cet.': these words of Lamb. Havercamp with his usual diligence prints
as a continuation of the words of Cicero cited just befor03 and Wak.
with a no less conscientious diligence remarks ‘locus etiam Ciceronis
nat. deor. Ι (1116111 Lambinus apposuit Lucretiano est consimillimus, baec

quaestio quare quod cuique libuerit id coyitet cet.’ The blunder does ,

some credit to their taste in Latin, as Cicero has seldom had a better
imitator than Lamb. Cic. epist. ad fam. XV 16 thus jokes with his

friend Cassius doceas tu me oportebit, cum salvus vener-is, in meane potes-
