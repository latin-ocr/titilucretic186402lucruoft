Boon v 367

and abiding‚ for he grants it to be probable that the sphere of ether and
the stars revolve: Ovid met. 11 204 altoque sub aethere fixis Incursant
stellis, was thinking doubtless of Lucr.: Lucr. as we have seen supposes
the stars to be above the sun and moon 3 probably therefore in the lower
part of ether. With this and all that follows comp. Democritus quoted
at 1193. 1207 in pectora caput eriqere i. e. assurgere et invadere pec-
tora. 1208 caput: 1 64 Quae caput a caeli reqionibus ostendebat.
1209 nobis the dat, ethicus: see n. to 1 797. 1211 rat. eq: 11 53
Quid dubitas quin omni' sit haec rationis eqestas? 1214 Solliciti: if
this be the true reading, comp. 1 343 Non tam sollicito motu privata
carerent3 VI 1038 Sollicito motu semper iactatur. 1216: 1 1004.
1217 = 379. 1219 Contralcitur is the opposite of diffunditur, expands
with joy: Cic. de nat. deor. 11 102 tum quasi tristitia quadam contrabit
terram, tum vicissim laetificat. correpunt, like a worm or other reptile
drawing itself together: ‘ tralatio est mirabilis et audax’ says Lamb.
1220 tellus—caelum: VI 287 Inde tremor terras qraviter pertemptat et
altum illurmura percurrunt caelum. 1223 Corripiunt= contrahunt,
but is stronger: 1v 83 correpta luce diei. 1225 Poenarum solvendi,
a constr. found not only in Plautus and Terence, nominandi istorum
copia, lucis tuendi copiam, novarum spectandi copiam 3 but also in
Cicero: phil. v 6 facultas aqrorum suis latronibus condonandi, de inv.
11 5 ex maiore enim copia nobis, quam illi, fuit eaeemplorum eliqendi
potestas: it is eurious that in all these instances the subst. governing the
gerund is the same or has the same meaning. 1227 Induperatorem...
Cum leq: Enn. ann. 552 Cum leqionibus quom proficiscitur induperator.
1229 divom pacem, grace, favour, pardon of the gods, is copiously illus-
trated by Fore. from Virgil and others: deum pacem eoeposcere, inventa
pace deum and the like are common in LiVy3 and I find two instances
of pam thus used in the new corp. inser. Lat. adit: Cicero has deos,
aras adire. quaesit: this old form, always retained in the familiar
quaeso and in quaesivi quaesitus, is found in Ennius several times: Cic.
Arat. 18 si quaesere perqes. 1230 must certainly be retained; for
repetitions like pacem, paces are very common in Lucr. and the older
writers: Hor. epist. 11 1 102 Hoc paces habuere bonae ventique secundi
looks like a reminiscence of Lucr.: the plur. paces is common enough.
animas: see n. to 1 715. 1231 saepe appears to be idiomatical, as in
Aen. 1 148, where see Prof. Conington: Luor. does not mean to say ‘in
vain, since he oflen perishes none the less’ 3 but what he means is this
‘ since in every case he perishes none the less for all his prayers, as we see
by many examples' ; saepe therefore means id quod saepe fieri videmus:
though less marked, it has essentially the same force in such passages as
11 85 and lv 34 where cum saepe means cum, ut saepe fit: 111 912 ubi
discubuere tenentque Pocula saepe homines i. e. ut saepe fit. turbine
