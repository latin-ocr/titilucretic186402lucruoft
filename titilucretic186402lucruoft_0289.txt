BOOK 111 271

ἐνοικῆσαι βίον, says Euripides or Moschion of the body. 9¹73 quam
nascimur ante: IV 884 quam mens providit quid· velit ante. 97¹7
Seneca must have been thinking of Lucr. 830—977 when he penned
epist. 54 4 mors est non esse . id quate sit iam scio. Ῐιοο erit post me
quod ante me fuit. si quid in hae re tormenti est, necesse est et fuisse
antequam prodiremus in lucem: atqui nullam sensimus tunc vexationem
[832 anteacto nit tempore sensimus aeyri] . . utrimque vero alta securitas
cet. [977 non omni somno securius coastat} Arist. eth. Nicom. 111 9
with truer instinct, φοβερώτατον δ’ ὅ θάνατος· πέρας γάρ, καὶ οὐδὲν ἔτι
τῷ τεθνεῶτι δοκεῖ οὔτ’ οἷγαθόν οὔτε κακὸν εἶναι.

978-1023 z the stories told of 11611 are really true of this life: Tan-
talus Tityos Sisyphus, the daughters of Danaus, are but types of people
ff tormented here by various lusts and passions: Tartarus too Cerberus
the furies have no existence 3 but are pictures of the various punish-
ments of crime in this world 3 and even if these are escaped‚ the tortures
of conscience make a hell of earth. 980 soll. this punishment is
assigned by him to many, as Pindar Cicero and Eurip. Orest. 5, a passage
Lucr. may have had before him, Τάνταλος Κορυφῆς ὑπερτέλλοντα δειμαί-
νων πέτρον Ἀέρι ποτᾶται,· where see Porson's copious note: he cites
among others Pausan. x 31 at end, who describes a picture of Polygno-
tus representing the Homeric punishments and in addition τό ἐκ τοῦ
ἐπηρτημένου λίθου δεῖμαε Polygnotus, Pausanias adds, followed Archi-

* lochus 3 but whether the latter invented the punishment he cannot tell.

981 cassa form. recurs 1049. 983 casum: there is an evident play
on the literal and figurative meaning of this word: comp. with the
above Cic. de fin. 1 60 accedit etiam mors quae, quasi samum Tantalo,
semper impendet, tum superstitio qua qui est imbutus, quietas esse num-
quam potest: he may well have been thinking of Lucr. here, as in Tusc.
disp. 1v 35 he draws a different moral from some tragic poet. 986

· Perpet. aetatem: VI 236 Quod solis vapor aetatem non posse videtur

Efficere. 989 Optineat: Wak. cites Livy XXII 2 8 omnia obtinentibus
aquis: for other instances see Fore. 993 volucres seems to be ex-
plained by anyer and curae, but as a poet 116 joins them by the simple
copula atque, and does not say hoc est anqor, or the like. anxius an-
yor recurs VI 1158: comp. Cic. Tusc. disp. 1v 27 estque aliud iracun-
dum esse, atiud iratum, ut differt anxietas ab an90re3 neque enim
omnes anxii qui anquntur aliquando, nec qui anoeii semper art-quntum
ut inter ebrietatem et ebriositatem interest, aliudque est amatorem esse,
aliud amantem: so that Lucr. may mean to express an abiding anguish3
or it may be only one of his many poetical pleonasms and, assonances:
see n. to 1 826 sonitu sonanti3 and comp. Virgil's imitation Aen. ΙΧ 89
timor anxius anyit 3 and Enn. trag. 256 otioso in otio, to which Cicero’s
rule might apply. 996 fasces cet.: v 1234 pulchros fascis saevasque
