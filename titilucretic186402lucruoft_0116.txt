book, which explain the operations of the other 866868, 1116 way in
which the mind and the will are excsted, the theories of food walking
sleep and the like, are more sketchy and unfinished‚ though they often
shew 661116 observation. The concluding two hundred verses are very
peculiar and display a satirical vein as* powerful and much more subtle
than that of Juvenal. The fifth book is also unequal: some few lines,
pointed out in their place, are almost unworthy of the poet and seem to
have been written down to fill up· a gap until he found time to change
them for better. The portions too in which he describes the movements
of the sun and moon and stars will not afford any great gratification.
But more than half the book, namely 416—508 and 771 to the end, are
in his noblest manner. Nothing in Latin poetry surpasses, if it even
equals these verses, in grandeur sublimity and varied beauty: occasion-
ally too some fine touches of earnest satire are met with: in these pas-
sages, as well 68 16 111086 mentioned above, he nobly maintains the
reputation claimed for his countrymen in 11161 style of writing. The
sixth book is unequal like the fifth: 1116 beginning as far 68 95 18 very
unsatisfactory and confused, as has been pointed out 16 1116 60168. Τ1166
follow some hundred verses in which the nature and working of thunder
and lightning, the formation of clouds rain and the like are described.
This portion is most carefully elaborated. There is not much room for
the highest virtues of poetry 3 but still great qualities are here brought
into play, quickness of observation and power of describing what is ob-
served, vivacity of narrative, ‚fine perception of analogy and much inge-
nuity of speculation: the language is simple terse direct 1611168. Most
of these merits are displayed in greater or less measure even in the flat-
test and most prosaic portions of the poem 3 but the verses here spoken
of are not of this number. Quite recently I was glad to find the opinion
I had long entertained of this section of the poem confirmed by the
greatest of German critics in Riemer's Mittheilungen ueber Goethe 11 p.
645 3 and this is not the only place in which Goethe expresses the most
unbounded admiration for our poet. What follows is not 80 satisfactory:
Lucretius has 10 include a great variety of questions in a very limited
space. These seem to be selected sometimes at hap-hazard: nearly 200
11668 616 given to the magnet, good and lively verses enough and very
ingenious, but out of all proportion to the subject-matter. The de-
scription of the plague of Athens concludes the book: it is manifestly
unfinished 3 and though it contains much noble poetry, it suffers from
the unavoidable comparison with the austere beauty and simple grandem·
of its original, which the poet 1168 601 always understood and from which
he has sometimes departed without good cause. He has shewn himself
here both too much and too little of a physician : he is too technical for
the poet, too inaccurate for the philosopher.
