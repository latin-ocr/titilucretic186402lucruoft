215—264 t nothing can be reduced to nothing : things dissolve only
into their first-beginnings z if this were not 80, a thing might pass away
in a moment without any force: again how could all things, animate
and inanimate, be replenished‘l if nothing were imperishable, infinite
time past must have reduced all things to nothing : a mere touch would
destroy all things alike: rains pass away ; but the earth which receives
them sends forth her produce3 and from it all animals are nourished:
nothing therefore is utterly destroyed. 216 Epic. after what is
quoted to 159, continues καὶ εἰ ἐφθείρετο δὲ τὸ ἀφανιζόμενον εἷς τό μή ὅν,
πάντ’ ἂν ἀπολώλει τοὶ πράγματα, οὐκ ὄντων τῶν εἰς ἃ διελύετο. dissoluat 2 as
in 3 places, 1 559 111 706 VI 446, this word must be of 4 syllables from
the necessity of the metre, Lucr. never ending a verse with 3 spondees,
I have followed Lach. in always so regarding it in those places also
where it might be a trisyll. as here for instance 3 though it is of course
a doubtful point. interemat and 226 peremit: A and B, as all good mss.
of all good authors, invariably thus spell these words. 217 Nam, 219
euim: Lucr. does not at all avoid thus using uam, euim3 uam, ‘nam3
euim, euim, and the like in consecutive sentences, as the Greeks use γάρ;
occasionally we find them in three successive clauses : 11 749 enim, 751
euim, 753 Ν amj, 111 754 enirn, 756 euim, 757 euim 3 v 7 Nam, 13 enim,
14 Namque. 221 Quod nuuc: see n. to 169 and also to 623. aet,
coust. sem: Madv. Cic. de fin. p. 517 says that Cic. never has the simple
abl. after consto but always ex: in Lucr. the former is very frequent3
more so than the latter: he also employs both constructions with con-
siste. 222 Dornee vis: obiit=exacffly 246 dum. . Vis obeat: donec and
doniqtce (the words are not found in Cicero) always, unless I am mis-
taken, in Lucr. take a past indic. with the exception of 1v 997 Donec
. . redeant3 and this is the usual constr. at least in the older writers.
224 videri here has the force of esse, which φαίνεσθαι so often has in
Greek: 262 it has its usual sense of to seem, and 270 it is a simple pas-
sive of video: Lucr. uses homonymes in this way again and again without
its appearing to strike him that there can be any ambiguity: we find
for instance in the same 01·- in contiguous vss. corpora in its ordinary
sense and in that of atoms 3 as 11 714 multaque caeeis Corporibus fuyiunt
e corpore: res and ratio are likewise found with quite different meanings.
227 lumina vitae occurs again more than once 3 it is also used by Virgil.
228 Redducit always has this quantity in Lucr. and generally this spel-
ling in A B: the same is true of reccidere which occurs thrice, redducere
occurring four times: the perf. reppuli repperi rettuli are of course
necessarily long. 230 iuqeuuei is almost sui: comp. VI 613 Adde
suos fontis of the sea: Plaut. miles 632 unites sua sibi inqenua indoles,
i.e. nativa. externa is the opposite of this, ‘ which come from without',
adventicia: comp. Cic. de nat. deor. 11 26 Nec enim ille externus et ad-
