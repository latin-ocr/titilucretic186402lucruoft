vis. 684 nidor: not only is nidor used here and elsewhere for odor,
but VI 987 he has nidoris odores.

687-7 05 ε 0116 8111611 will travel farther than another, but none so far
as sound: I need not add as the images which excite sight ς for it
travels slowly and is soon lost, because it comes with much ado from the
inmost parts of thingS, as proved by this that things when pounded or
dissolved by fire smell more strongly: the atoms too of 8111611 are greater
than those of voice, since often a wall will stop the one and not the other 3
and thus too dogs often lose the 806111. 688 alio, alter: alter thus used for
aliu-s, though unusual, 1601118 V 835 ex alio terram status eaecipit alter: just
before, 829, he had said Eoc alioque alius status eoccipere: Plaut. capt. 8
uses alium for alterum: Seni kuic fuerunt filii nati duo: Atium quadri-
mum puerum servus surpuit. 689 quisquam in the masc. thus applied
to an inanimate thing seems as rare, as its use as an adj. agreeing with
an abstract subst. illustrated to I 1077 quisquam locus. 693 facitis
seems here to mean readily absorbing 13116 806111, 6 861186 1101 very dif-
ferent from the common one readily yielding. 699 quam voce: see 11.

that two of 13116 greatest Latin scholars of modern times should have
found fault with it: Lamb. says here ‘Latine dici non potest videre licet
odorem maioribus principiis constare quam voae' 3 and Madvig. opusc. pr.
pJ 312 makes a like'objection to III 614 ut anquis. '704 calida is

706—721: but in the case of the forms and colours of things, as
well as 81116118 and tastes, some are suited to one creature, unsuited to
another: thus for example the lion fierce as 116 18 06111101 face the cock.
'706 hoc refers of course to the argument which ended with 686, that
the particles of a thing which excite taste and smell will often fit one
creature, not another. It is hardly possible then to contest what Lach.
says, that this is another of the passages added by Lucr. and not properly
connected with the rest of the poem. '710 explaudentibus must mean
driving off the night with their noise, as an actor 18 driven off the stage.

unlike is 153 quam meminit levor praestare salutem, and Virg. geor. 1

introduced. Pliny twice mentions what is here asserted of the lion, VIII

with inter in Lucr., as IV 716 interfod- dig a passage through, VI 333
intersuq- fiy through, and IV 868 inter-datus, distributed through '
