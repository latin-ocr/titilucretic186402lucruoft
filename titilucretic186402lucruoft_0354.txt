locare': there is no real authority for the word in Cic. Tusc. disp. copied
out of Fore. by Wak: Virg. 601. VI 35 discludere Nerea ponto the sense
is essentially the same. 447 448 sorsum, Seorsus: see n„ to 111 631.
449—494: the heavy particles of earth collected in the midst and
squeezed out the lighter atoms of the other parts of the world: ether
with its fires first burst forth and collecting on high formed the 0111361·-
most sphere of the world: between it and earth the rudiments of sun
and moon and stars took up their position: the earth, rid of these lighter
particles‚ sank down still more where the bed of ocean is ; and these
depressions were flooded with salt water3 and the more the earth was
beaten upon by the 116613 of ether and the sun, the more it was con-
densed, and thus increased the ocean by particles of moisture squeezetl
out of it, and the heavenly elements of fire which flew off from it.
