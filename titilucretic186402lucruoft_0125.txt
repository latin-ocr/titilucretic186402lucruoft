Then he loves to bring together the same or like-sounding words or ex-
amples of oxymoron in conjunction with other alliterations and asson-
ances or by themselves: omnes omnia, omnibus mimium· again and again

eet. cet. Virgil’s fondness for similar artifices is probably in great measure
derived from Lucretius. After Virgil’s time they appear to be less fre-
quent in Latin literature: 11001)Ιο probably got tired of them, as has
happened in other literatures. This love of assonance in all its shapes
our poet indulges to such an extent, that his ear and taste appear not
unfrequently to have become blunted by satiety: often within the com-
pass of two or three lines he will use some of his favourite wordS, such
as res ratio or corpora, three or four or five timeS, without there being
any point or force whatever in their repetition. The most glaring ex-
amples are pointed out in their places, Many other modes of producing
effect might be noted in Lucretius, such as his habit of putting to-
gether substantives without any copula: Prata lacus rivos seyetes,· Ossa
cruor venae calor umor viscera nervi: but let the examples given suffice.
In his alliterations and assonances as well as in the rhythmical move-
ments of his verse and the style and colour generally which he imparts
to his poem Lucretius seeks rather for the most direct and obvious
means of producing effect, thau for the more subtle and recondite arts
of Virgil. His ornament therefore is apt sometimes to be in excess,
sometimes to be deficient3 yet even the plainest and most prosaic parts
of his poem shew a sincerity of thought, a force of reasoning and a racy
idiomatic flavour of style which render them less dull and uninteresting
than the fiatter portions of many more carefully elaborated works.
Standing as Lucretius did entirely aloof from what would most excite
the sympathies of his contemporaries, there is not much evidence to
shew what reception his poem met with from the great mass of his
countrymen. It sufficiently appears however that he and Catullus were
justly esteemed the two greatest poets of their age. Yet there can
be no doubt that his work came into the world at a time very unfavour-
able for the fame of its author. He would take no part in the great
movement then in active progress which ended in producing the works
of Virgil Horace and Ovid and fixed once and for ever the Roman
standard of poetical taste. The splendour of their reputation threw into
the shade that of their greatest predecessors, Ennius Lucretius Catullus:
they obtained the unanimous suffrages of the best critics of the empire,
at the head of whom stood Quintilian. The reaction in favour of the
