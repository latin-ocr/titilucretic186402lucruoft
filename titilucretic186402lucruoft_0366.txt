of these theories may be true, and as none can be proved not to be true,
none being opposed to sense, all are equally true: any one therefore

and Lucretius had before them in writing their physics, and not the
vain ambition to propagate idle mathematica] and other theories. ¹707
and '724 Ad speciem=ad visum: 1v 235 quae poterit res Accidere ad
speciem quadrata3 242 speciem quo vertimus. 708 pleno bene: this
use of bene is a favourite one with Cicero. '712 siquorum per orbem :
see n. to 691 siqnifhri orbis. Lucr. here gives a lucid statement of the
true cause. '714 cursus viam: 1124 iter viai and 11 626 iter omne
viarum seem not unlike: Vitruvius IX 2 1 (4 17) cursum itineris sui
perayens. ¹715 Est quare possit :est ut possit, so common in Lucr. :
see n. to 1 442 erit ut possint: it means therefore simply potest3 and is
not used as 730 sit cur, where cur has its usual force: see also 11. 10
V1 132. Plut. de plac. phil. 11 28 mentions Anaximander and Antiphon
as holding that the moon shone with its own light3 but who hit upon
this notion of the parasitica] opaque body in order to explain its phases,
I don't know. The observant Thales taught that its light was derived
from the sun.

'720 si forte :fortasse, is found in Cicero, as de off. 11 70 in uuo illo
aut, si forte, in liberis eius manet qratia: see Madvig emend. Liv. p.
123‘: it serves therefore here as a connecting particle in passing to a
new hypothesis, and is the same as Est etiam ut versari possit, ut ylobus

cet. '723 eam partem i. e. the dimidiam partem just mentioned.
¹726 ylomeraminis atque pilai seems a hendyadis for the ylobus pilai of
720. 72¹7 Babyl. Chald. doct.: 116 speaks of the theory of Berosus,

of which Vitruv. IX 2 (4) gives a full account ε Ι will quote the begin-
ning, Berosus qui a Chaldaeorum civitate seu natione proqressus in
Asiam etiam disciplinam Chaldaicam patefecit, ita est professus, pilasm

autem cursum itineris sui perayeus subiret sub orbem solis, tunc eam
