100 NOTES II

critus and the other early Greek philosophers. Empedocles receives his
homage partly as one of these, but mainly because he gave him the
best model of a philosophical poem. Ennius is extolled at the beginning
of his work as 1118 master in Latin verse. Lucretius thus to all appear-
ance stood aloof from the swarm of contemporary poets and left them to
quarrel and fight among themselves, as even the best of them seem to
have been ready to do. The Augustan poets of the first rank afford a
rare and most pleasing example of brotherly harmony and good feeling ;
but if Catullus and Calvus had not died in early manhood, there are
many indicatione that they and their school would have come into pain-
ful 0011181011 with Virgil and Horace and their partisans. Lucretius we
cannot picture to ourselves as joining in the lampoons on Caesar, much
as to all appearance 110 disapproved of his policy.

Notwithstanding the antique tinge which for poetical ends he has
given to his poem, the best judges have always looked upon it as one of
the purest models of the Latin idiom in the age of 1 ts greatest perfection.
Fifty vouchers might be cited for this 3 but the following will suffice:
the prince of critics declares emphatically in the scaligerana that there
is no better writer than Lucretius of the Latin language. Lambinus
and Lachmann have certainly not been sut-passed in modern times as
Latin scholars and Latin writers, and both moreover studied Lucretius
with unwearied diligence: the former who edited Plautus Cicero and
Horace as well as Lucretius 111-0110011008 him to be ‘omnium poetarum
Latinorum qui hodie exstant et qui ad nostram aetatem pervenerunt
elegantissimus et purissimus idemque gravissimus atque ornatissimus’3
and in another place he tells Charles lx that the style of Cicero or
Caesar is not purer than this poet's: the latter 18 never weary of ex-
tolling his ‘ sermonis castitas’, his ‘lactea ubertas’ and the like. And in
truth whoever 1108 110011 01100 imbued with the Latin of Plautus Terence
Cicero Caesar and Lucretius, cannot but feel what painful inroads Greek
and often debased Alexandrine Greek had made into the language even
of the Augustan writers, and what irreparable mischief it had occasioned
in the tintes of Quintilian and Tacitus to thought as well as to idiom.
It isin the style and structure of his language that this purity 18 ob-
servable: 111 single words he has by 110 11100118 obeyed the emphatic
adjuration of his great contemporary to shun like a rock a new and
unusual term 3 but has taken a poet’s privilege, most valuable in his
case, to coin hundreds of new words which have been pointed out where
they occur and to introduce not a few from the Greek. And here will
be the place to make some remarks on the poet’s own complaint of the

poverty of his native tongue. We may first assei-t 08 011 indisputable ·

fact that in his day the living Latin for all the higher forms of composi-
tion both prose and verse was a far nobler language than the living
