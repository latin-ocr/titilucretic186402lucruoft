400 NOTEs 11

Ribbeck's edition I find that the mss. of Virgil are ten times in favour
of deriyo, once only of diriyo. 826 aestum: 111 17 3 mentis, qui yiy‘nitur
aestus. 828 vomenda: Aen. IX 349 vomit ille animam. 829 comp.
v 359 quia 'nulla loci fit eopia circum.

830—839: sometimes this exhalation causes a partia] void, so that
the bird cannot support itself on the wing, but falls down and perishes.
836 nixari: see 11. to 111 1000: it is almost or quite a Lucretian word,
and is the frequentative of niti. 838 iacentes, because unable nixari
insistereque alis: it has much the same force as 744 molli cervice pro-
susae.

840—84'7: the water of wells is colder in summer, because they let
out their seeds of heat through the earth which is then rarified by heat:
the contrary is the case in winter for the contrary reason. 845 Fri-
9ore—concrescit: see n. to 111 20 nia· acri concreta pruina.

848—8'78: the fountain by the temple of Hammon is cold by day,
warm by night, not, as is absurdly said, because the sun below‘ the
earth warms it, but because the earth about it condenses at night and
so squeezes into the water its seeds of heat ; and then by day receives
these back agaim—Curtius Arrian Pliny Mela and others speak of this
property of the fountain: Ovid met. xv 309 medio tua, corniqer Hammon,
Unda die 9elida est, ortuque obituque calescit. Curtius 1v 31 gives the
fullest and most precise account. 854 and 863 corpus aquai: Emped.
285 ὕδατος τέρεν δέμας ἀργυφέοιο. 858 satiare: Cic. Arat. 364 Cum
supera sese satiavit luce, where mss. have sociavit ,- Germanicus 588
Siderea vix tum satiatus luce, the words of Aratus being ὁ δ’ ε’πὴν φάεος
κορέσηται. 864 roriferis cet: Aen. 1v 351 quotiens umentibus umbris
Nox operit terras. 868 aquae: see n. to 552. 869 dimovit
appears to have the same force as in Virg. geor. 11 513 Aqricola incurvo
terram dimovit aratro. 875 in lucem=in luce: see n. to 712 in
aestatem. 877 quasi, in the sense of ‘as‚' is very common in Lucr.
878 nodos, a bold continuation of the metaphor involved 111 eoeolvit:
Hor. epist. 1 3 3 Hebrusque nivali compede vinetus, Petron. sat. 123 v.
188 undarum vincula rupit: comp. too 531 mora quae fluvios passim
refrenat euntis.

879—905: there is also a cold fountain which ignites tow or pine-
wood put over it: it contains many seeds of latent fire, which rise up
and set on fire this tow or wood‚ as flame will light a freshly extin-
guished wick‚ before actual contact.-—Pliny 11 228 tells this fact of a
fountain at Dodona, to which Lucr. also probably refers. 890 endo:
see n. to 1 82 Induyredi. Aradi: Aradus or Arvad a populous island
011 the coast of Phoenicia: this fountain was very famous: see Strabo
p. 754 for the use the inhabitants made of it: it is said to be used in
the present day. 892 multis aliis cet: Pliny 11 227 dulcis haustus i‘n
