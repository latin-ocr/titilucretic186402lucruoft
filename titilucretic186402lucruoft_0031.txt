-two mss. now at Leyden, he would at a glance have seen their im-
portance and would scarcely have failed to complete the edition which he
was then meditating. The great knowledge of Epicurus’ system which
he displayed two years later in his Boyle lectures and his zeal for the
recently published principia of Newton would have aided him 111
expounding the tenets of the poet. This however was not to be3 but
his marginal notes published in the Glasgow edition 01 Wakefield prove
what he could have done, if he had gone 011 with his design. Ι 06111101
doubt that Lucretius would have suited him better than Horace, and
have offered a fairer field for the exercise of his critical divination.

In 1695 there came from the Oxford press a Lucretius edited not
by Bentley, but by Thomas Oreech fellow of All Souls, a man 01 sound
sense and good taste, but to judge from his book of somewhat arrogant
and supercilious temper. The text is nearly always a reproduction of
0116 01 other of the editions of Lambinus: such criticism indeed he
seems in his preface to look upon as beneath him. His notes are in
most cases mere abridgements of those 01 Lambinus 01 copied from
Faber, and his illustrations are usually borrowed from the former. All
this he does as if it were a matter of course, not thinking it necessary
either to avow or conceal his obligations. His interpretatio is his own:
how far it is 01 assistance to a student must depend upon what he seeks
for in it. His Lucretius however owing to the clearness and brevity of
the notes has continued to be the popular one from that time to the

p The worthy London bookseller Jacob Tonson published in 1712 a
finely printed text with various readings at the end collected from many
quarters with a good deal of trouble, some of value, most quite worthless
This Ι chiefly mention on account of what follows. In 17 25 Sigebert
Havercamp professor at Leyden gave to the world his variorum edition
in two huge volumes. Though his reputation has never been great, my
readers will hardly perhaps be prepared for what Ι 6111 going to say. As
Professor in Leyden 116 had the full use of the two Vossian mss. there,
the main foundation of 6 genuine text: how did he use this advantage,
which in profession he makes so much of 2 The chief feature of his
edition is 6 vast and cumbrous apparatus of various readingS, derived
from about thirty-one sources professedly distinct. Of these thirty-one
twenty-two are simply the various readings of the London edition just
mentioned which Havercamp has taken aud tumbled into his own with-
out changing the notation. Most of these are of the most futile nature,
taken from worthless editions which reprint or ignorantly depart from
those of Giunta Aldus Lambinus or Gifanius, such as that of Pareus
Gryphius Fayus Nardius and the French translator the Baron de Cou-
tures: the more worthless the authority, the more fully it seems to be
given. There are also some collations of the mss. of Vossius and that 111
1116 Bodleian which it did the London bookseller credit to get together.
The nine remaining authorities are these: a certain Basil edition of 1531,
its marginal readings, a collation of the Verona edition os 1487, 6180
jottings in its margin from three unknown mss„ a second collation of
the Bodleian, and lastly the two all-important Leyden mss. The two
last are the only authorities he has collated himself. How has he per-
