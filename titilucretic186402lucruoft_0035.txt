661166. There can be little doubt that carried away by the strength of
his admiration for Lachmann he 1136 followed him too faithfully 3 yet he
not unfrequently differs from him. Where he recalls the old reading
he is generally right 3 where 116 deserts him for a conjecture of his
own, he is often very successful. Had he prepared a more elaborate

, edition, as he appears to have once had thoughts of doing, there is no

doubt that Lucretius would have owed him much. The impulse given
by Lachmann to the study of our poet has called forth numerous papers
either inserted in the German philological reviews or published by
themselves. Some are of more, some of less importance: my notes will
shew where I have been indebted to them. One English publication of
eminent merit, as it criticises not the text of the poem, but its matter
and poetical beauties, shall be mentioned elsewhere.

To return now to the manuscripts whose history was sketched above.
Though I examined the two at Leyden for some days so long ago as the
autumn of 1849, what will now be said of them is borrowed from
Lachmann who had them in his hands for six months and during that
time applied the whole force of his practised and penetrating intellect
to unravelling all their difficulties and obscurities. Both, as already
mentioned, belonged to the magnificent collection of Isaac Vossius.
The older and better of the two is of the ninth century written in a
clear and beautiful hand: I call it A. It has been corrected by two
scribes at the time that the ms. was written, as Lachmann tells us.
One of these is of great importance: in most essentia] points he agrees
minutely with the ms. of Niccoli, the oldest of the Italian mss. ; and
doubtless therefore gives the reading of the archetype. It will be
seen in notes 1 how often I make the united testimony of A and Niccoli
to outweigh all the rest. The other Leyden ms. which I call B is of
nearly equal importance: it is of quarto size closely written in double
columns, apparently in the tenth century. It is probable that it and
,the ms. next to be mentioned were copied from some copy of the
archetype, not like A from the archetype itself. Four portions of the
poem are omitted in their place, but come together at the end in this
order, 11 757-—806 v 928—979 1 734—785 11 253—304. Lachmann
has demonstrated that these sections formed each an entire leaf of the
lost archetype: 16 29 39 115 316 the numbers of these leaves. It is
manifest then that after A was copied, these leaves of the archetype
had fallen out of their places and been put together without order at
the end, before Β, 01 the original of B, was copied from it. More will
be said on this point presently. B has had several correctors, but all of
the l5th century3 one a very brilliant critic for his age, to whom are
due many of the finest emendations in the poem, as will be seen in
notes 1. This ms. was once in the great monastery of St. Bertin near
St. Omer. Turnebus collated it in Paris and his collation as we saw
was used with much effect by Lambinus: it afterwards came into the
possession of Gerard John Vossius, Isaac's father. A large fragment of
another 1116. closely resembling B in everything double columns and all,
except that it is said to be a small folio, not quarto in sbape, is now at

Oopenhagen: it contains book 1 and 11 down to 456, omitting however
the same sections as B, viz. 1 7 34-785 and 11 253—304, and doubtless
