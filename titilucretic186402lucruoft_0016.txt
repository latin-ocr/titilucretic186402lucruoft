to all who take an interest in such studies: from my first in-
troduction readers will learn what opinion I entertain of his
11161116 ; they will also find that all which I have added to what he
has donc is with one insignificant exception derived from the
original sources to which they refer. The manuscripts there cited
were examined by myself 3 the editions and manuscript notes
were open before me all the time Ι was at work. The large
amount of critical material thus amassed I have endeavoured to
put into as concise and compressed a form as possible3 though
much 01 11116 1116161161 needs perhaps to be recorded only once and
might be greatly abridged 11 11 1166 ever to appear again in a new

The length of the explanatory notes calls I fancy for less
excuse. This very year three centuries have elapsed since Lambi-
nus published 1116 first edition of his Lucretius; and from that
day 10 11116 nothing new and systematical, nothing that displays
pains and research 1166 been done for the elucidation of our author.
Transcendant as are the merits of that illustrious scholar, what
was suited to 1564 can hardly satisfy the wants 01 1864. No
defence then is needed for the extent of this division of my com-
mentary: if it were done over again, more would probably have to
be added than taken away. It will not be so easy perhaps to
excuse the translation. This however is really a part of the
explanatory notes3 and if it had been left undone, they must
have been enlarged in many directions, Our author too unless
I am mistaken will admit 01 being thus treated better than most ;
and the fashion 01 1116161 translations seems to be gaining ground
in this country as well as in Germany and France.

To the advice and friendly assistance 01 my brother fellow
Mr King‚ our highest authority in that branch of art, is due the
likeness of the poet which appears on the titlepage. With K. O.
Mueller, Emil Braun and other judges he is convinced that the
original on a black agate represents our Lucretius, The style of
