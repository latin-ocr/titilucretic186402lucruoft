himself in the language of Anaxagoras ; with whom however as we have
shewn in the first book he and Epicurus had many points of contact,
points which are well brought out here. What Lucretius means to say

come from the mingling of the elements of ether and earth 3 and at
their death these senseless elements return whence they came to bc
employed afresh in producing other things z the elements are the same,
it is only their motions arrangements etc. which make the difference:
