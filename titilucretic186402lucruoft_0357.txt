heaven must revolve 011 its axis3 this axis therefore must be supported
in its position: this is done by an air pressing outside on each pole, and
keeping each fixed in its place: but then to put the sphere in motion
another force is wanted: this must be a third air3 but it may act 111
two ways, it may blow at right angles to the poles either above the
sphere in the direction in which the sphere has to move with its stars,
01 it may blow underneath in the opposite direction, moving it thus 66 a
stream of water passing under a wheel moves the wheel‚ that is to say

Lucr. and the contrivance gives a good picture of what he means. 522
aliunde fluens alicunde extrinsecus, another instance of pleonastical lan-
guage: alicunde is ab aliquo loco, the opposite of aliquo: so that ali.
alie. seems to be only ab aliquo alio loeo, and extrinsecus implies the
