his comment p. 3 b on the words of Aristotle just quoted reeords that
according to Alexander of Aphrodisias the epicureans on this point οὐκέτι
συνεφώνησαν Δημοκρίτῳ z this Epicurus himself in Diog. Laer. x 42
distinctly eonfirms, καὶ καθ’ ἑκάστην δὲ σχημάτισιν ἅπλῶς ἄπειροί ἐἰσιν
ἄτομοι, ταῖς δὲ διαφοραῖς οὐχ ἅπλῶς ἄπειροι ἀλλὰ μόνον ἅπερίληποιε the
number of shapes is not infinite, only inconceivably great: this careful
limitation is added no doubt with reference to Democritus. Lucr. simply
states and argues that the number is finite, without deciding whether it
is large or small. 4¹79 Ex hoe cet.: it derives its proof from what has
been said, because though there is so much difference in things in regard
to hardness softness, smoothness roughness and 13116 like, yet these differ-
ences are only finite: see 500 foll. 480 = 514 finiti-3 differre fiquris.
481 rursum iam refers to 1 615 : it will once more follow, though 113 was
there proved to be impossible: see below 499 supra quod iam cet.
484, 48¹7 and 490 corporis is of course the atom: see n. tol 600 Corporis
illius. Lucr. seldom has to speak of a single atom: when he does men-
tion one, he has hardly any word for it but corpus, as here. 485 fac
enim cet: he begins with quoniam3 then with fae enim he commences
6 361163 of clauses, so that the clew of the construction is dropped 3 and
495 Erqo commences an apodosis to 611 that has preceded, referring not
only to quoniam cet. but also to fac enim and all that follows: the
anacoluthon is however very slight, if it exist at all: comp. 111 425—439.

minimis e partibus: this has been fully explained 1 599 foll.: these minimae μ

partes, which could not exist alone and had no distinctive qualities, Luer.
seems 130 have regarded as each perfectly identical ς 30 that the atom
took its shape and character solely from the mode of juxta-position in
which these existed from everlasting in the atom ; and three he seems
to have thought the very smallest number that could compose one of his
solid atoms. 490 Formai speeiem: comp. 1v 69 formai fiquram.
491 Quod superest: see n. to 1 50. 492 Addeudum partis: see n. to
1 111: the permutations will soon come to an end and to increase the
shapes new parts must be added. 494 eliam, once again, still, which
the comio poets shew to have been an idiomatieal use: Cic. Verr. 111 175
clio, elie etiam elarius. 496 Subsequitur, 613 01166 follows upon. 498
maximitate: see n. to 1 653. 499 supra i. e. 1 615 foll. With what
precedes comp. Epicurus himself m Diog. Laert. x 56 πᾶν δὲ μέγεθος
ὑπάρχον οὔτε χρησιμόν ἐστι πρὸς τας τῶν ποιοτήτων διαφορας, ἀφῖχθαί

500 Meliboea: Lucr. tells us that this was the Thessalian townt' ,4
it lay on the shore, between Ossa and Pelion: Aen. v 251 Purpura

Μ aeamlro duplici Meliboea cucurrit 3 where Prof. Conington says ‘ M eli-

boeus is formed from it as an adj. by poetieal lieence, as 111 401 ducis
