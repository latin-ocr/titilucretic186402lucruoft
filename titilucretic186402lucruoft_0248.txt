M ortalem vitam mors eum inmortalis ademit, v 121 Imnwrtalia mortali
sermone and the like. With the above vss. comp. Cic. de nat. deor. 1 54
in liae iyitur inmensitate latitudinum lonqituolinum altitudinum infinita
vis innumerabilium volitat atomorum cet. 1058 natura, by natural
causes, not by divine power or necessity. 1059 verses like this appa-
rently wanting a caesura are not uncommon in Lucr. and other poets:
comp. VI 197 Conplerunt, maqno indiqnantur murmure clausi 3 in three
other instanees, 111 612, 715, v 165, the word inmortalis occurs 3 so that
in our verse and all the others it may be presumed that the preposition
of the oompound formed a quasi caesura ; for in fact the Latins seem to
have made no differe-enee in sound between in mortali and inmortali:
Lucilius ventures to write Scipiadae mayno improbus obiciebat Asellu83
and in the new corp. inser. Lat. we find on the one hand ab iuraverit,
acl tribuere 7 timeS, ea: aetum, in cloueimus and many such like 3 on the
other hand aquo, amatre, adeum, desuo, exformula, inmanu, obeas and a
hundred such like. There is one other instance, 111 258, Nune ea quo
paeto inter sese mioeta quibusque, where sese may be presumed to be
divided in the same way. Lachmann’s distinction between a short vowel
as in forte, and along vowel as in mayno or an m as in quid enim in-
mortalibus, so that our present verse shall not be a legitimate one,
appears to rest on no reason or authority. 1060 tem. ine. β·.· comp.

plication here these words are synonymes: but before him Cic. Arat. 32

not only other worlds, but innumerable other worlds, as he proves in the
next paragraphs: with this and what follows comp. Epio. himself in
Diog. Laer. X 45 ἀλλὰ μήν καὶ κόσμοι ἄπειροί εἰσιν, εἶθ’ ὅμοιοι τούτῳ εἰτ’

1067-1076 : nay when there is matter and place ready, and nothing
to hinder, and countless atoms with the same powers as those which
have formed our world, you must admit that there are other worlds with
men beasts ete—A mere variation of the last paragraph. 1069 con-
