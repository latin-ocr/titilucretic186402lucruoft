nilo yiqni divinitus. 158 (155) quaeque is neut.: comp. 57. opera sine
divom is said perhaps with reference to Attius 159 Nam uon facile siue
deum opera humana propria s‘cmt bona.

159-214: ‘if things could come from nothing, any animal might
’ be born any where, any fruit grow on any tree. But that every
thing comes from a definite seed is, proved in many ways: flowers corn
fruits come at stated seasons: again anima-Is and plants require time to
grow up: the products of the earth want rain at stated times, animals
food: men are of a definite size, and never grow to a gigantic bulk:
lastly the fruits os the earth require cultivation, and do not improve
spontaneously’. From the nature of the case· this is rather a full state-
ment of what he means by nothing coming from nothing than a proof t
his theory of fixed unchangeable seeds of things· or atoms he subsequently
demonstrates with masterly clearness and power: some of his arguments
evenNewton seems not to have disdained to borrow. 159 almost a
transl. of what Epic. himself says in his letter to Herod. Diog. Laert. x
’ 38, quoted by Lamb. and others, οὐδὲν γίνεται ἐκ τοῦ μή ὄντος· πᾶν γσῖρ
ἐκ παντός ἐγίνετ’ ἂν σπέρματός γε οὐθὲν προσδεόμενον. 16]. mare: Foro.
v cites several instances of this abl. from Ovid and others: add to his ex-
amples Ovid ars am. 111 94, Ibis 196 (200): Ovid seems licentious in this
point: he has caeleste bimenstre and other such ablativos. primum fol-
lowed by no deinde or other particle: VI 1068 Saxa vides primum cet. ε
this form of expression is common enough in Cicero and others: Ter.
Andr. 211 primum iam de amore Ῐιοσ comperit : Me infensus servat cet. ε
Virg. georg. 111 384 primum aspera silva· cet. 162 is squamiqerum
nom. sing. or gen. plur.‘l for the former you have mortale, humanum
yenue and the like3 but Lucr. also says Ito-minum qenuse, etc. and else-
where he uses the word only as a subst2, squamiqerum pecudes occurring
twice. Lamb. marks it as a· gen.: v* 1156 clivom. yenus humanumque
shews how indifferently he uses bot-h constructions. 111 73 the gen. con-
sanquiueum seems a harsher contractiori than squamiqerum3 or IV 586
qenus aqricolum, or Aeneadum: see also n. to v 727 Chaldaeum. 163
wrm. at. al. pec. may be looked upon as one clause in appos. with qen. om.
fer. 166 Virg. georg. 11 109 Nec vero terrae ferre omnes omnia pos-
sunt ε the expression is prob. almost proverbial, like ‘non omnia possumus
omnes. 167 Quippe is here· joined with 168 Qui: ubi—cuique being
a separate clause: so 242 Quippe belongs to quorum: ubi—corpore
being a separate clause t* but 182 Quippe ubi are of course connected.
yen- corp. see n. to 58. 169 Ac nune, very common in Lucr. when he
is passing from what is not to what is true 3 also 221 quod nuuc,
675 Nunc iyitur 3 110 and VI 570 Nunc, alone. 170 171 for constr.
comp. n. to 15. iude ubi=ex eo, in quo. 1¹71 materies and corpora
prima are of course synon. 3 see n. to 58 foll. 172 common as quare
