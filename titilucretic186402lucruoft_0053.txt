Boox 1 35

834 quom Lach. for quam. Lamb. reads Principium rerum quam and
joins it with what precedes: he is followed by all before Lach. and may
be right. ‘quid quod ita ne dixit quidem usquam Lucretius, sed rerum
principia Ι 740 1047 11 ‘789' says Lach. Yes, because his primordia are
pluralg but 1 707 116 writes Et qui principium yiynundis aera rebus Cou-
stituere of those who have one first-beginning of things. 835 6 Ald. 1
and Junt for de. 839 840 aurique...aurum. As he immediately enu-
merates the three other elements‚ Bentl. proposes auraeque...auram.
‘quid hic aurum? oculos credo interpretum praestrinxit...Simplic. tamen
[in Arist. phys. fol. 6 b] de Anax-ag. πάντα τοὶ ὁμοιομερῆ οἷον τὸ ὕδωρ ἦ
πῦρ ἢ χρυσον etc.’ This and other passages seem to defend the text:
yet comp. 853. 843 ulla parte idem Nic. Nice. vulgo for ulla idem
parte. ulla idem em parte Lach. because Lucr. 116 says only omits the
preposition when a genitive is added. But in rebus seems equivalent to
one: comp. J uven. VI 43¹7 Adque alia partein trutina suspendit Homerum.
846 illi supra quos Ald. 1 J unt. marg. Flor. 32 for illis uira quod A, quo B
Gott. illis juoeta quod Camb. Vat. 1954 Othob. viris iuoeta quos F lor. 31.
illis iuxta Ang. Politian in marg. F lor. 29. 852 qffuyiat B corr. Flor. 31
for efficiat. 853 sauquen an ossa marg. F lor. 32 and Lamb. for sanquis
an os. sanquis was unknown to Lucr.: 1v 1050 sanquis νηπίω V1 1203
sanquis expletis: see Lach. and add Sen. Med. 776 and Val. F lacc. 111
234 sanquis. Flor. 31 does not as Lach. says read sanquis arn, an os.
sanyuen os aurum Lach. an awkward and improbable correction. 860:
the verse lost here Lamb. thus supplies, Et nervos alieniqeris ex partibus
esse ; which must be very like what Lucr. wrote. 866 sanieque. venisque
Avanc. Lamb. Lach. without necessity I think. Avancius formed his
text by correcting Ven. and it as well as Ver. have sanisque,· hence
perhaps venis. mixto Lach. after Ald. 1 J unt. Lamb. which have misto,
mixtim Ang. Politian in marg. Flor. 29, which may be right. 8¹73: here
there is I believe a hiatus of two or more verses which I formerly sup-
plied thus, Ex alieniqcnis quae tellure exoriuntur. Sic itidem quae Ziqua
emittunt corpora, aluntur Ex cet: comp. especially 859-866 and notes
2. In 874 Ι have added his after liquis. I hardly understand Lach.
who reads quae alieniyenis oriuntur. See also Luc. Miiller de re metrica
p. 284, who seems to prove that a monosyll. diphthong is never elided
before a short vowel. J unt. followed by Gif. Creech omits both 873
and 874. Lamb. followed by Wak. only 8733 which seems absurd: he
reads in 874 liquis exoriuntur with Flor. Oamb. etc.

882 cum saxi Ald. 1 J unt. etc. for cum in saxi, 884 lapidi lapidem
J unt. etc. for lapidi in lapidem. ‘recte, ut puto, etsi cur addita sit
[praep. in] non intellego’ Lach. terimus Nic. Nice. for tenemus. 885
herbis. herbas Ald. 1 J unt. Lach. vulgo. 886 laticis F lor. 31 Gamb.
for latices. 887 quali B, qualis A, quales A corr. Nic. Nice. Flor. 31
Camb. ubere. ubera Lamb.: the exact reading is uncertain. 890 iuter
terram Lach. first for iu terram: other editors have blundered strangely.
res added by Nic. Nice. Β 6011. etc. 900 flammai J unt. for flammae:
a simple correction, yet overlooked by many of the later editors. Even
Nauger has here deserted J unt. and reads fulserunt flammae fulyo‘re.
909 contineantur Nauger. for continyantur. 912 et B corr. Wak. for 6.

932 animum. ani-mos Lamb. Oreech after Lactantius inst. 1 16. Pius
