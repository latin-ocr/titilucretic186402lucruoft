BOOK 1 125

Delphes no. 18 we find the praenomen Κόϊντος more than once, but 1. 112
Τίτος Κοίγκτιος of Flamininus: yet in the new corp. inser. Lat. 1008
Quinem-s is once found3 and Plaut. trin. 524 Α has quincto: but this
spelling seems to have been quite obsolete in the time of Lucr.: comp.
too fartus samus, setius, in Plautus still sectius. 71 cupiret: Enn.
ann. 10 Ova parire solet 3 384 si vivimu' sive morimur 3 Ov. met. XIV 215
cupidusque moriri.

'73 Epic. is of course the subject of Processit and peramavit. flamm.
moen. mundi a noble expression which frequently recurs, to denote the
fiery orb of ether that forms the outer circuit of the world: its nature is
fully described in the fine passage v 457—470, ending with Omnia sic
amito complexu cetera saepsit, imitated in paradise lost ΙΙΙ 721 The rest
in circuit walls this universe: the use of ‘ universe ’ is of course quite
unepicurean. It may be a question whether mundi in this phrase
means the whole world, or is a synonyme, as it so often is, of caelum or
aether: it certainly appears 10 have 1116 latter meaning in v1 123, where
capacis well expresses the avidus complemus of ether : the former seems
more poetical and is confirmed by the imitation in Manilius 1 151 Flam-
marum vallo ‘naturae moenia jecit, where naturae clearly denotes the
whole world: this constant imitator of and carper at Lucr. has also 486
moenia mundi in a passage where he is trying with his usual heaviness
to refute Epicurus and him. '74 an emphatic oxymoron: he passed
beyond this world and traversed in thought the immeasurable universe:
Cic. de fin. 11 102 1111131 surely have been thinking of this passage when
he says haec ‘non erant eius qui innumerabilis mundos infinitasque re-
qiones quarum nulla esset ora, nulla eoetremitas, mente perayravisset: see
Madvig: and Hor. od. Ι 28 5 animoque rotundum Percurrisse polum
morituro. meme animoque a mere poetical tautology: 111 84 animum
(lico, mentem quam saepe vocamus 3 and all through that book they are
synonymes 3 116 more than once too uses mens animi, as does Catullus
after him: Virgil was probably thinking of these words and this rhythm
in Aen. v1 11 maynam cui mentem animumque 3 though the expression
is common in prose, as Cic. de leg. Ι 59 animo ac mente conceperit, and
Tac. Germ. 29 and Caes. de bell. Gall. 1 39. 7 5 Lamb. seems right
in comparing refert victor with Aen. 1v 93 laudem eb spoila ampla
refertis: where refertis however is simply ‘carry home’, as Plaut. Poen.
1v 2 25 domum haec ab aede Venem's refero vasa. At the same time it
here unites the common and cognate meaning of a messenger 01· 1116 like

bringing back a report: see Madv. Cic. de fin. p. 311, who says Livy
first used it for narrare: but Virgil did so surely before him: the two

senses I have tried to combine. The end of this and the whole of the
next two verses are repeated again in this book and in the 5th and 6th.
