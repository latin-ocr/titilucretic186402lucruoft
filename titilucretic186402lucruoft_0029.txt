complished one tenth of what Lambinus succeeded in doing. Lachmann
accuses him of strange levity and rashness. But it must be remembered
that in a short life he got through an amazing amount of work in con-
formity with the wants of his age. He only gave two years and a half
to his brilliant edition of the whole of Cicero 3 and probably did not
spend many more months on his Lucretius than Lachmann spent years.
Nor was it possible in that age even for a Lambinus to apprehend the
true relation of the mss. of Lucretius to one another. His copious
explanatory and illustrative commentary however calls for unqualified
eulogy, and has remained down to the present day the great original
storehouse, from which all have borrowed who have done anything of
value for the elucidation of their author. Scaliger says ‘Lambinus avoit
fort peu de livres’: if s0‚ he made good use of them, as his reading is as
vast as it is accurate, and its results are given in a style of unsurpassed
clearness and beauty. His notes observe the mean between too much
and too little: he himself calls them brief, while his thankless country-
men, thinking however more perhaps of his Horace than his Lucretius,
have made lambin and lambiner classica] terms to express what is diffuse
and tedious. A second and much smaller edition with only a few pages
of notes, but with many variations from the first, was published in 1565.

Scarcely could this first edition have issued from the press, when
the well-known scholar and jurisconsult Obertus Gifanius of Buren
began with systematical and unprincipled cunning to pillage it and con-
vertit to his own purposes. His Lucretius was printed by Plantin of
Antwerp in 1566 as stated at the end, though of two copies before me
the title-page of one has on it 1566, the other 1565, which is the date of
his own addrcss to Sambucus, and of the two privilegia at the end 3 for
the march 1564 of the first must be old style, as it is later than the
february 1565 of the second. He brought nothing new to his task,
except the ms. notes of Marullus in the old Venice ed. fully spoken of
above, for the emendations and readings of Antonius Goldingamus
homo Anglus, which he speaks of in his preface, and the veteres libri and
the like which occur throughout his book are mere blinds to conceal his
thefts from Lambinus. The way in which he contrives at once to be-
stow empty praise on this scholar and yet to extenuate his merits and
put him as a commentator of Lucretius on the same level with other
learned vmen, Turnebus for instance, is a marvel of astuteness In the
preface to his third ed. Lambinus states the truth with great terseness:
‘omnia fere quae in eo Lucretio recta sunt, mea sunt 3 quae tamen iste
aut silentio praetermittit aut maligne laudat aut sibi impudenter arro-
gat '. Yet so great was the skill with which all this was done that he
deceived many and was thought to be a worthy rival of Lambinus.
Contrary to what many believe, the age loved brief notes, and his were
brief, the other's copious. Even the great critic of that generation
J oseph Scaliger, who well knew the character of Gifanius and accused
him *of gross deceit towards himself, says ‘ Gifanius estoit docte, son
Lucrece est tres-bon '. Lambinus however knew the truth, and his
wrath was as signal as the provocation. In 1570 he brought out a third
edition greatly improved and enlarged3 much of the additional matter
however consists in invectives against the aggressor. In a long preface
