120 NOTES II

with such an intention, his headstrong muse has got the better of his
philosophy, and constrained him to follow her guidance. This perhaps
is his best defence, if defence be needed: νουθετεῖται μὲν ὑπὸ τῶν πολλῶν
ὦς παρακινῶν ἐνθουσιάζων δὲ λέληθε τοῦς πολλούς. Montaigne, essais ΙΙΙ
5, 1133 well perceived the characteristic features of this passage. He
quotes the latter part of it and then compares it with a fine passage of
the Aeneid, VIII 387 folI.; and thus concludes ‘Quand je rumine ce
reicit, pascit, inhians, molli, fovet, medullas, labefacta, pendet, percurrit,
et cette noble circumfusa mere du gentil infusus, j’ ay desdain de ces
menu‘e‘s pointes et allusions verbales qui nasquirent depuis’. How tame
even Spenser’s elegant paraphrase and Dryden's translation are by the
side of the original. Lamb. cites with approbation P. Victorius who
argues from Plut. adv. Col. and Cic. de nat. deor. 1 45, that Epic. did not
forbid sacrifice and prayer to the gods; ‘ habet enim’ says Velleius ‘ve-
nerationem iustam quidquid excellit' 3 but he adds that Lucr. prays
here not as a philosopher, but as a poet.
Many motives doubtless were acting at once on the poet's mind.
Venus was symbol of the all—pervading living force of nature3 she was
s legendary mother of the Romans: Mars ruled the first, she the second
month of spring and the year. Mars indeed in the old Italian mythology
was the youthful and beneficent god of plenty, father of the Latin races:
‘cum hodieque’ says Macrob. sat. 1 12 8 ‘in sacris Martem patrem,
Venerem genetricem vocemus’. Why then does Lacr. desert the true

old conception of this god, one seemingly well-suited 130 1113 purpose, and 1

adopt the Greek legendl From the time of Ennius at least the Roman

poets good and bad alike borrowed the setting of their poetry from Greece: ’

the fauns and casmenae had yielded for ever before the muses of He-
licon. Mars had now become an Ares, the destroying lord of war.
Again though Empedocles' poem on nature was much shorter than that of
Lucr. and doubtless in many respects inferior, yet to some extent it was

to the latter what the Iliad and Odyssey were to Virgil, his technical model. ⁷

Among the recently discovered fragments of Empedocles there is an ad·

dress to Calliope which Lucr. prob. had in his mind when he penned VI ³
94. Empedocles’ two great principles of love and strife by whose alter·
nate victory and defeat he personified the ceaseless round of nature had ‚22

evidently a great infiuence on Lucr. Comp. now the passages quoted by “

Sturz Emped. 240 sqq. Eustathius there tells us that Empedocles made

the union of Ares and Aphrodite the symbol of his love, their release by ἶ
Hephaestus the symbol of his hate: Heraclides in his allegories declares ἶ
