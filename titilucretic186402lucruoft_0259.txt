τῶν αἰσθήσεών ἐστιν ὅ περὶ τὴν καρδίαν τόπος; 30 With Epicurus the
animus was not the heart, but in or about the heart: Cic. Tusc. disp. Ι

sed alii in corde, alii in cerebro dixerunt animi esse sedem et locum: the
beart had more advocates than the brain. reqione in pectoris: Lucr. is
fond of this position of the prep.: 463 morbis in corporis 3 824 morbis

Caecilius omnibus laetitiis: Pompon. 141 laetitias: so v 48 desidiaeque.
liic erqo: the τὰ λογικόν of Epicurus, the consilium, mens or animus of
Lucr. 143 per totum dissita corpus, a translation of Epic. 1.1. παρ’
ὅλον ‘td ἄθροισμα παρεσπαρμένον. 144 numen here perhaps unites the
physical sense which it has 11 632 and 1v 179, 61111 the metaphorical
sense of will, much as Catul. LXIV 204 Adnuit invicto caelestum numine

quue, the consilium of 139 and 140. Attius 296 Sapimus animo,
fruimur anima: sine animo anima est debilis. 147 Et quasi cet. : the
eye and the head may be affected without the rest of the body feeling
with them, but when these are more violently assailed by disease, the
rest of the body sympathises, shewing thus that it is one with them: so
it is with the animus and anima. 155 infrinyi linquam: the καμ

her famous ode. aboriri: V 7 33 he has the unexampled form aborisci.

160 exim is the spelling of our mss. and of the best authorities.
icit: 1v 1050 unde icimur ictu: the phrase foedus icere is found in
Cicero: see Foro.

161—1'76: the animus and anima are therefore bodily also, since
they can move and direct the body 3 for this cannot be without touch
nor touch without body: the animus too suffers with the body, when
the latter is wounded: it must then be bodily, since it suffers from

bodily weaponS. 161 Corpoream: Epic. 1.1. 63 says ὅτι ἦ ψυχὴ σῶμοί

431 sed viribus ensis adactus Transabiit costas: those who would join
intus with adacta might appeal to VI 23 where intus would go most
naturally with receperat: 1 223, 11 711 and IV 1091 intus, properly ex-
plained, has its proper force. 173 Seqnis: with this might be com-
