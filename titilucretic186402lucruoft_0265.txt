χρωμένην, ὅταν τοὶ στεγάζοντα καὶ ,περιέχοντα μή τοιαῦτ’ ᾗ ἐν οἷς νῦν οὖσα
ἔχει ταύτας τοὶς κινήσεις.

350-357; to say that the body has no sense, and that the soul
spread through it alone feels, is to contradict a self-evident truth: but
it is said when the soul departs, the body has no sense: yes, because
sense is no inherent property, but an accident only. 350 refutat: as
this cannot be really disproved, but only denied‚ Lambinus' renutat is
very specious: but refutat may well imply tries to disprove or thinks
he disproves. 354 corpus sentire=corporis sensus: see n. to Ι 331.
adseret 1. e. rationem adferet: thus we have had more than once reddere
:rationem reddere: comp. Cic. Tusc. disp. 1 70 credo equidem in capite,
et cur credam adferre possum. 355 palam dedit z apertum dedic or
jecit: comp. 11 568 palam est, and n. there. 35¹7 proprium=xa6'
αὖτό συμβεβηκός or coniunctum: see 1 451: sense is a mere eventum,
which comes to both body and soul by their reciprocal action one upon
the other 3 and when this ceases, all sense ceases for both alike. Lach.
I now see to be mistaken in mai-king off this and the next two para-
graphs‚ as not connected with what precedes and follows: the above vss.
are a clear continuation and completion of the preceding argument 3 are
iu fact a summary of Epic. 1.1. 64 διὸ ἀπαλλαγείσης τῆς ψυχῆς οὐκ ἔχει
τήν αἴσθησιν [τό σῶμα] · οὗ γοῖρ αὗτὸ ἐν ἑαυτῷ ταύτην ἐκέκτητο τήν δύναμιν,
ἀλλ’ ἑτέρῳ ἅμα συγγεγενημένῳ αὐτῷ παρεσκεύαζεν, ὃ Bw? τῆς συντελεσθείσης
περὶ ati-td δυνάμεως κατοί τήν κίνησιν σύμπτωμα αἰσθητικὸν εὐθὺς ἀποτελοῦν
ἑαυτῷ, ἀπεδίδου mro? τήν ὁμούρησιν καὶ συμπάθειαν καὶ ἐκείνῳ, καθάπερ
εἶπονῑ it gets for itself and imparts in turn sense to the soul. 357 in
aevo = in vita 3 so ex ineunte aevo five or six times = ex ineunte vita.

359—369: the assertion that the eyes cannot see, but that the mind
sees through them, as through a door, is contradicted by their sense:
nay bright obJects often hinder the eyes from seeing them ,- but this
could not happen to doors3 nay if eyes act as doors, we ought to see
better by entirely taking away these doors. 359 fol].: Sextus adv.
math. VII 350 says οἳ δὲ αὐτὴν [τήν διάνοιαν] εἶναι τοῖς αἰσθήσεις, καθάπερ
διά τινων ὀπῶν τῶν αἰσθητηρίων προκύπτουσαν, ἧς στάσεως ἦρξε Στράτων τε
ὅ φυσικός καὶ Αἶνησίδημος; Lassalle Herakl. 1 p. 316 well compares with
this what Sextus 1. l. 130 says of Heraclitus, ἐν δὲ ἐγρηγορόσι πάλιν διοῖ τῶν
αἰσθητικῶν πόρων ὥσπερ διά τινων θυρίδων προκύψας [ὅ ἐν ἡμῖν νοῦς] καὶ τῷ
περιέχοντι συμβαλών λογικὴν ἐνδύεται δύναμιν, and suggests that a compari-
son of this passage on the one hand with that quoted just above and on the
other with this of Lucr. makes it highly probable that the illustration
here employed came from Heraclitus: in what relation to him Aenesi-
demus stood is well known3 the other, the peripatetic Strato of Lamp-
sacus who went by the name of ὁ φυσικός, seems also to have been much
indebted to him. This connexion in the present case will appear yet
