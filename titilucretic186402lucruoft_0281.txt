appears very tautological3 unless Praet. male adm. depends on peccata
i. e. quae male admissis peccavit.

830—869: thus the soul being proved to be mortal, death is nothing
to us; for as we felt no discomfort, when Rome and Carthage were
warring for the empire of the world, we shall feel none after the dissolu-
tion of body and soul, though heaven and earth go to ruin: if our' soul
even do exist after death, that is nothing to us, whose identity consists
in the union of soul and body: or if infinite time to come collects again
and gives life to the very same atoms of which we consist, that is
nothing to us, when this identity has once been brokenj, even as we
know and remember nothing of our former selves, if as is probable infi-
nite time past arranged the atoms just as they now are in us: death
will prevent us from existing in that future time and feeling the ills
that may befall that repetition of ourselves: death then will at once
make us for evermore as if we never had been. 830 foll. Epicurus to
Menoeceus in Diog. Lacr. x 125 says τὰ φρικωδέστατον οὖν τῶν κακῶν ὀ
θάνατος οὐθὲν πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἐπειδήπερ ὅταν μὲν ἡμεῖς ὦμεν, ὅ θάνατος οὗ πάρεσ-
τιν, ὅταν δ’ ὁ θάνατος παρῆ, τόθ’ ἡμεῖς οὐκ ἐσμέν. 831 liabetur here:

both of them allude to Ennius perhaps or Naevius? 839 uniter apti
recurs 846 3 and the phrase is found thrice in V, uniter being apparently
used by Lucretius alone: the words are opposed to discidium, and ex-
press that organic union of body and soul which gives a man his indivi-
duality and personal identity. 842 Non si terra cet. a proverbial
