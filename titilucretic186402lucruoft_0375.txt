BOOK v 357

lived like the beasts of tho field5 ignorant of tillage, they fed on what
the earth supplied of itself, acorns and berries 3 and drank of the run-
ning waters: they were without fire or clothes or houses, without law
government marriage: they slept on the ground, not fearing the dark,
to which they had been used from childhood: they rather dreaded real
danger from the fiercer beasts. 926 Durius cet. Virgil’s homines
durum yenus and Ter-rea proqenies. quod is of course the rel. pronoun,
:quippe quod cet. or ut pote a tellure productum as Creech interprets.

reyibus. 946 decursus aquai or aquarum is a favourite phrase which
he uses four times. 947 Olaru’ citat is a very graphio expression: the
clear rills tumbling down from the high hills in those climates are
audible from a great distance, especially Per loca pastorum deserta atque
otia dia: Lach. in his sarcastic and most unsatisfactory note says ‘ feras
decursum aquae, qui vix audiri potest, frustra clare audire iubet.' What-
ever it may be with the waters from the high hills of Berlin, those from
the hills of Greece and Italy can be heard far enough. Had he known
more of those countries, he would not by changing nec into hic make
Horace invite Maecenas to quit his palace where he had the whole scene
before his eyes and to come to the poet's villa where he would have had
to look through or over many maqni montes in order to see the Aesulae
arvum and the Teleqoni iuqa parricidae. With the use of Clarus comp.
