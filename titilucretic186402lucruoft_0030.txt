12 NOTES I

of great power and beauty of style he states his wrongs. There and
throughout his commentary the whole Latin language‚ rich in that
department, is ransacked for terms of scorn and contumely. The same
charges are repeated in a thousand different shapes with curious copious-
ness and variety of expression. Gifanius with consistent cunning at-
tempted no public reply to all this. Many years afterwards, when
Lambinus had long been dead, a new edition of the other's book was
brought out at Leyden in 1595, in which many additions are made to
the brief notes, but not a word is said of the charges brought against
him by Lambinus. He was rewarded for his reticence, and for a century
or more opinion was divided as to whether he or Lambinus did more for
Lucretius, In private he corresponded with the cankered and unhappy
Muretus: the two exchanged futile charges of dishonesty against the
dead critic, who was far too genuine a scholar to be capable of being a
plagiary. Lachmann so stern with Avancius has nothing to say of this
much more fiagitious case: ‘qui quo iure' he observes ‘aut Lambinum
aut alios compilasse dictus esset non quaesivi ’. Gifanius had no busi-
ness whatever to edit a poet: he was without poetica] taste and grossly
ignorant of metre.

For a century after Lambinus nothing was done for Lucretius: the
common editions followed either Lambinus or Gifanius. In 1658 the
singular labours of Gassendi were given to the world. Deeply versed
in the works of the fathers and the philosophy of all ages down to the
latest discover-ies of Dese-artes he devoted himself with the zeal of a
disciple to the dogmas of Epicurus. The two first of his huge folios are
given to this philosophy, and a large portion of them to :the exposition
of Lucretius. Much that is curious may be gathered from them, and I
have perused them with attention 3 but to say the truth Ι have not
found much to my purpose in them. The author was utterly devoid of
the critical faculty, and all that is of value in him on this head is
borrowed from Lambinus, as well as the most useful of his illustra-
tions: his corrections of the text are without exception worthless.
In the l7th century several distinguished scholars, Salmasius J. F.
Gronovius Nic. Heinsius Isaac Vossius, turned their attention to
Lucretius 3 but their labours were only desultory. Of the mss. notes by
the two last which are in my possession I will speak afterwards. In
1662 Tanaquillus Faber or Tanneguy Lefebvre published at Saumur a.
text of Lucretius followed by emendationes and notulae. He was a
elever but vain man, who seemed to think such work rather bene-ath
him3 he takes care however to inform his reader that he spent but
little time or pains on it, and had only Lambinus and Gifanius before
him, though he owed nothing to either. The truth is that without
Lambinus he could not have advanced a step: elever man that he is, he
affords a good proof how grievously Latin scholarship had deteriorated
in France during the century between him and Lambinus. Of Pareus
N ardius Fayus nothing need be said. ·

Had Bentley in 1689 or 1690 succeeded in his efforts to obtain for
the Bodleian Isaac Vossius' famous library‚ he might have anticipated
what Lachmann did by a century aud a half. As he was at that very
time working hard at LucretiuS, if he had once got into his hands the.
