of this passage. 130 tum cum primis cet. that we may know the real
nature of the soul 3 unde, out of what elements‚ viz. bodily 3 and so not
be misled like Ennius and others, or dread eternal punishment. tum
cum: tam: cum A B3 also 111 710, VI 250 both have tunc before a con-
sonant, but nowhere else. Lach. therefore, as Flor. 31 Camb. before
him, properly reads tum after the usage of older writers: see also Wagner
quaest. Virg. XXV 5: it speaks well for our mss, that they err so rarely:
tunc before a consonant must have become common in the silver age.
132 Et quae ‘res etc. as explained in the 4th book: res is the imaqines or
simulacra, ‘images or idols’‚ εἴδωλα, which are shed from all things, not
the bloodless phantoms, which Ennius seigns to issue out of Acheron3
and which terrify us when sick or asleep. The constr. of this vei-se mis-
understood by Oreech is shewn by IV 33, which is the best comment on
it, Atque eadem (simulacra) nobis viqilantibus obvia mentes Tere-{fleant
atque in somnis, cum saepe fiquras Contuimur miras simulacraque luce
carentum: it thus appears that viyilantibus and morb. adf are here in
apposition. The emphatic repetition of these horrid visions seen in
sickness might seem to confirm what is related of the poet being subject
to fi‘rs of delirium, or disordering sickness of some sort. 133 som. sep:

him. 135 repeated 1v 734, but there quorum begins the verse. Virg.
Aen. x 641 has morte obita and v 31 tellus...9remio complectitur ossa:

’ Cicero also uses ‘morte obita. As he treats of the soul and these images
’ at such elaborate length in 111 and lv, it might seem that the motives he

here assigns are too narrow 3 but the fact is that like a true disciple of
Epicurus he wishes to persuade his readcr or himself that he discusses
these questions not for their scientific interest, but to free man from
vain fears of the gods and death, and to produce that tranquillity of
mind, without which happiness is not possible: he reiterates the same
just below, 146-158.

136-145: ‘the task is difficult 3 but love of you and your worth en-
courages me to labour to make these questions clear'. 136 Nec me animi
fallit is found also 922 and v 97: Ter. eun. 274 ut falsus animi esc:

, this use of animi is common after many verbs and adjectives: pendere

animi is in Cicero 3 Plautus trin. 454 has Satin tu es sanus mentis aut
afnimi tui, shewing the idiom is not confined to animi. Madvig emend.
Liv. p. 136 says ‘ neque Cicero neque Livius neque quisquam post comicos
et Lucretium (apud quem est animi fallit) genitivum illum adiunxit nisi
iis verbis, quae dubitationem et sollicitudinem significant'. 138

to the cultivation of suitable friendships. Observe that Lucr. speaks only
