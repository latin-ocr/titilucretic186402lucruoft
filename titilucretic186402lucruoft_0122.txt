104 NOTEs 11

trinsecus ut: more rarely a dactyl and spondee or two spondees, but then
a monosyllable must follow, Sive voluptas est, Non temere ulla vi; In-
mortali sunt, N ami cum multo sunt, Vis est, quarum nos: once indeed
with great boldness, but with singularly happy effect, 111 527 Et mem-
bratim vitalem deperdere sensum. Instances of such rhythms in Virgil
maybe counted on the fingers: he has Scilicet omnibus est labor inpen-
dendus, Armentarius Aser, Sed tu desine velle, Sparqens umida mella,
probably all in imitation of Lucretius 3 and Per conubia nostra aster
Catullus’ Sed conubia laeta, with him too a mere exceptional rhythm for
a peculiar effect. In Cicero's early work the Aratea similar instances
are found Verum tempora sunt, I nclinatior atque,· but they are rarer
than in Lucretius: in the 80 or 90 verses still remaining of his poem de
consulatu suo written about five years before the death of our poet
there is not a single example. In the middle of the verse too Lucretius
has many favour-ite movements, most of which are not unexampled in
Virgil Catullus or Cicero but are much less common, such as Quid
nequeat finita potestas, Detulit ex Helicone perenni, Amnibus inveniuntur
aperto, Finita variare fiqurarum ratione, Omne qenus perfusa coloribus,
Pocula crebra unquenta, and a hundred such. Cicero has some pretty
verses in his prognostica which suggest the manner of Lucretius Vos
quoque siqna videtis, aquai dulcis alumnae, Cum clamore paratis inanis
sundere voces, Absurdoque sono fontis ct staqna -cietis...vocibus instat,
Vocibus instat et adsiduas iacit ore querellas: the latter passage Lucretius
v 298 has manifestly imitated. In the fifth and sixth feet of the verse
too so important for the rhythm the manner of Lucretius is much more
like that of Ennius and, in some points, of the Greeks, than that of
Virgil or Catullus or even Cicero: he delights to close the verse with
such words as principiorum materiai simplicitate, or vis animai, saecla
animantum, mente animoque, and does not even avoid such harsh elisions
as quandoquidem eoetat, perpetuo aevo, praeterea usquam. Now in Virgil
such endings as quadrupedantum ancipitemque, and in Catullus such a
one as eqredientem are exceedingly uncommon. But these poets make
one striking exception in favour of Greek words and delight to close a
verse with hymenaeus Deiopea Thersilochumque and the like: a conces-
sion to Greek rhythm and a prettiness which Lucretius would not care
for. As for the other rhythms just mentioned, Virgil says maqmmi cui
mentem animumque and simul hoc animo hauri in acknowledgment
doubtless of his obligations to Lucretius: they produce a striking effect
in the AEneid from their extreme rarity. Lucretius again does not
decline spondaic endings as naturai, aeternumque, et mortalis, sint in
motu,· once even inventi sint ,· but these are much rarer than such end-
ings as principiorum, and it is worthy of note that he abstains from them
altogether in the sixth book. On the contrary Catullus and Virgil use
