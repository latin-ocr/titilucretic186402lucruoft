1158 11592' Thuc. adds to the words last quoted καὶ αὗται μετοὶ
ταλαιπωρίας μεγάλης, referring to the great distress caused by the violent
vomitings: Lucr. having as we saw quite misrepresented the rest of the
sentence, would not understand these last words: he has therefore given
quite a different turn to the words of Thuc. in these two vss.: he
certainly does not refer to the sentence here'quoted by Wak. ε his trans-
· lation of it comes later, as we shall see. 1158 anxius anglor occurred
above 111 993. 1160 Sinyultus frequens represents 'Thucydides' λῦγξ
κενή, which is commonly explained to be an empty retching, where
nothing is brought up. 1167 ut est cet. ε ‘ut est sacer ignis, dum per
membra diditur’ Lach. sacer iynis: see n. to 660. 1172 partim:
nonnulli, as often in the best writers: 1211 partim: 1210 nonnulli,
1208 partim metuentes... Vivebant 3 111 78 Intereunt partim, and else-
where. 1175 ipso defines the part with which they eagerly sought
the water. 1176 Insedabiliter seems not to be found elsewhere.
sitis, mersans: a bold but expressive metaphor: thirst so drenches the
body, that no after drenching of water can overcome it. 1177 ἐν τῷ
ὁμοίῳ καθειστήκει τό τε πλέον καὶ ἔλασσον πότον. 1179 mussabat,
another fine metaphor, muttering under breath, as not knowing what to
prescribe and therefore not daring to spe-ak out: see Prof. Conington to
geor. 111 550. 1180 patent-ia, ardentia, eapertia: see notes 1 and 2
to v 692 693. ardentia morbis Lumina, 1186 Creber spiritus cet,-
1203 Corruptus sanquis cet.: Virg. 1. l. 504 Sin in processu coepit eru-
descere morbus, Tum vero ardentes oculi atque attractus ab alto Spiritus
...it naribus ater Sanquis: this would serve to defend ardentia, if it
needs defence: morbis seems to mean each with his own disease: but
with 1180 1181 comp. Ovid met. VI 246 simul suprema iacentes Lumina
versarunt, animam simul exhalarunt, and VII 579 Lassaque versantes
supremo lumina motu; which might seem in favour of Lachmann’s
subtle and possibly true emendation: the peculiar rolling of the eyes
before death is a very marked symptom. This symptom and most of
those which follow down to 1195 are not found in Thuc.: they appear,
most of them at all events, to be derived from the writings of >Hippocra-·
tes which Lucr. must have been well acquainted with 3 and not to have
any special reference to this plague: Lucr. indeed seems to forget for the
time that he is describing the gradual progress of a disease in which
some died and others recovered as is told farther on 3 and to think only
of drawing a moving picture of the signs of coming death.

1183 Perturbata cet.: παραφροσύνη 111 various forms is men-
tioned by Hippocrates as θανάσιμον. animi mens: see n. to 111 615.
1184 Triste sup. cet.: Hippocr. prorrhet. 1 49 mentions the προσώπου
rei λίην σκυθρωπόν as avery bad symptom. 1185 so Hippocr. praenot.
Coac- 193 βόμβος ἐν ὀξέσι καὶ ἦχος ἐν ὠσὶ θανάσιμον. 1186 Hippocr.
