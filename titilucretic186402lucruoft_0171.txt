Lucr. as soon after 658 and 743. 51¹7 as inane is so oft. a subst. in
Lucu, surely in. rer. for ‘ the void of things in being' is not harsher
than 363 natura inanis (gen.) and 365 plus esse . . inanis. 521 and 526
corp. certa: certus in Lucr. Cicero and the best writers sometimes ap-
proaches in meaning quidam, and our and the French certain 3 or rather
to certus quidam: corp. certa here=precisely 675 certissima corpora
quaedam: comp. also 812 alimur ‘nos Certis ab rebus, certis aliae atque
aliae res3 and VI 7 83 Arboribus certis. 523 the omne or omne qaod
est consists of spatium or omne quod est spatium and corpora in its
widest sense, as shewn at length later in this book: Wak. and others by
placing the comma after spatium utterly pervert the argument. The
whole of this paragraph is rather an attempt to state clearly and ful] y
what he means by his assumption that his atoms are impenetrably solid
and imperishable 3 the demonstration of this will come in the succeeding
sections. 525 naviter: so Cic. ad fam. V 12 3 eum bene et naviter
oportet esse impudentem. omne or omne quod esc is of course nomin. to
extat. 529: so 11 539 penitas penetrari. retexi: so 243 contemtum
for their structure: one cannot tell whether retexi is gov. of possunt or
queunt: Lachmann’s punctuation assumes the latter. 530 temptata
labare: 537 temptata labascit 3 11 967 dolore Temptavi ; v 345 cum res
tantis morbis tantisque periclis Temptarentur: temptare is a proper term
for being assailed by disease. 531 supra paulo: if he refer to 485
foll. that seems merely a part of the present argument: perhaps he al-
ludes to 169—204. 532 conlidi. . franyi=clissolvi emmam-ecus icta:
findi sec.:penetrata reteoei : 534 535 are exs. of 530. 533 nee findi
in bina secando, the expression which comes nearest to the technical
Greek name ἄτομα or ἄτομοι, a literal rendering of which Lucr. with
poetical tact always avoids. 534 manabile, a word formed by him to
express what 494 he called penetrale: manare is a favourite word of his
in similar senses. 536 Lucr. always says quo mayis or quanto mayis
or, as once VI 460, quam quoque maffia—tam maqis: never quam m.‚
tam m. 543 supra: 149 foll. 54'7 reparandis: this verb is often
used by him in this poetical sense, to produce anew. With the above
section may well be compared the words of Epicurus himself 1. l. 41 ταῦ-
τα. δ’ ἐστὶν ἄτομα καὶΔ ἀμετάβλητα, εἴπερ μὴ μέλλει πάντα εἷς τό μή ὂν
φθαρήσεσθαι, ἀλλ’ ἰσχύοντα ὖπομένειν ἓν ταῖς διαλύσεσι τῶν συγκρίσεων,
πλήρη τήν φύσιν ὄντα καὶ οὐκ ἔχοντα ὅπη ἢ ὅπως διαλυθήσεταιῖ Plut. de
plac. phil. 1 3 p. 877 D gives a good definition of the atoms: Newton
too would seem to have had Lucr. in mind when near the end of his

” ’ optics, ed. Horsley IV 260, 110 wrote ‘it seems probable to me that God

in the beginning formed matter in solid massy hard impenetrable move-
able particles, of such sizes and figures and with such other properties
and in such proportion to space, as most conduced to the end for which
