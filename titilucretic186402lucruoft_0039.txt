IN TRODUCTION 2 1

though A and B prove that it retained many valuable vestiges of great
antiquity, especially in the spelling of words, and though there may
have been few stages between it and the age of the author. There is
one point, the nature of the hiatus after 1v 126, as to which it is not
easy to accept Lachmann’s theory. That there is a hiatus there, is
indisputable and the special questions connected with it are fully dis-
cussed in note 1 to that passage. As the accidental loss of a whole leaf
would not suit his system of pages, he boldly declares that twenty-five
verses and one heading have perished, that is one single page of our
archetype. Now it is easy enough, as we have seen, to explain the
accidental loss of a leaf, by which every subsequent copy must neces-
sarily want the contents of that leaf: it is easy enough to conceive any
one ms, A or B or Poggio's‚ passing over by mistake one whole page.
But it is in the highest degree unlikely that different copies, A B and
Poggio’s‚ neither of which as Lachmann admits was copied from the
other, should all pass over a single page of their origina13 or that this
single page should be wholly illegible, while that which preceded and
the reverse page of the same leaf should be entirely uninjured. It
seems to me therefore much more natural to assume that our archetype
or one of its predecessors accidentally omitted an uncertain number of
verses 3 or rather that a whole leaf of the archetype had been lost, as
after VI 839. Lachmann’s system of pagination would then be set
right in this way t only books 1v and V have an index capitum prefixed
filling one page: before this index in v Lachmann has shewn that the
archetype had one blank page. Assume now that one page was sitni-
larly left blank before the index of 1v and all will be right.

But we are able to advance even beyond the archetype: in many
parts of the poem there are manifest undoubted interpolation8‚ which
must have been inserted by some reader who wished at one time to con-
firm what is said, at another to convict it of inconsistency and the like.
Generally, not always, these passages are repetitions of genuine passages;
sometimes they consist of several, sometimes of a single verse: 1 44-49
and 111 806—818 are good and incontrovertible examples. But enough
is said of these throughout our notes. Lachmann however still unsatis-
fied has not paused even here, but has gone up to the very times of the
poet. No careful reader will refuse to admit that he has proved not a
few passages, some of them among the finest in the poem, to have been
subsequent additions made by the author, which he did not live to em-
body properly with the rest of his work. Lachmann has gone too far3
and unless I err, I have shewn that not a few sections, thus marked by
him, are properly connected with what precedes and follows. Yet it is
certain that his theory applies to 11 165—183, and more than one long
paragraph of IV v and VI. It has been shewn sufficiently in the notes
to these passages that the most important of them have a close connexion
in matter and manner with each other. Like Lachmann, I have marked
them off by [ ]. All through the poem many single verses and passages
of some length are designedly repeated by the poet, some of them again
and again. It is probable that he would have removed many of them,
if he had lived to revise his work: the exordium of 1v for instance could
hardly have been intended to remain.
