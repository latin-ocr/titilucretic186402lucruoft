Boox v Α 349

prietatem luminis, ad lumen. cum autem evocata ad solis orbem supe-
riora spectent, tunc inferiorem partem eius, quod candens non sit, propter
aeris similitudinem obscuram videri, and so on: hence his followers were
called Chaldaei. Chaldaeum is of course the gen. plur. ε 1063 canum
Molossum3 405, VI 754 and 11 600 Graium 3 VI 642 Siculum. '728
Astrol. artem is the system of the astronomers who held the first men-
tioned theory. '729 quod puqnat, a constr. common enough in Cicero:
de nat. deor. Ι 75 illud video puqnare te 3 pro Sex. Rosc. 8 si hoc solum
puqnatur: so qui id puynant and the like. 733 aborisci seems to be
iound nowhere else: ΠΙ 155 116 has aboriri: Lach. compares ulcisci
pacisci nancisci proficisci etc. '734 illius in parte z this use of pars in
the sense of locus, seems to come from the sense it has in partes ayere or
suscipere : reparari in loco illius et partes or partem eius suscipere : Cic.
ad Q. frat. 1 l 43 si mea pars nemini cedit, fac ut tua ceteros vincat:
comp. too Ter. eun. 1055 ut haeream in parte aliqua tandem apud Tha-
idem. 735 vincere verbis : 99 Et quam difficile id mihi sit pervincere
dictis: Virg. geor. 111 289 verbis ea vincere maynum Quam sit3 but
there the words are the same, the sense different. '73'7--74'7 seem to
depict some pantomimic representation of the four seasons. 737
praenuntius: Hor. epist. Ι 7 13 O'um zephyris et hirundine prima for the
first approach of spring: comp. 1 10 foll. 739 Flora follows close
behind and scatters fiowers before her which fall close on the steps of
spring Venus and zephyr, implying that fiowers spring up wherever
they have trodden: tibi suavis daedala tellus Submittit flores, when

Venus alone has to be glorified. '741 Inde loci: see n. to 443.
742 etesia stab. aquil. recurs VI 730 : 715 Aut quia sunt aestate aquilones
ostia contra Anni tempore eo qui etesiae esse feruntur. '743 Euhius

and euhoe are the only well-attested spellings3 probably Euhan should
also be read3 for Aen. VI 517 the best mss. have euhantis: the Latins
naturally expressed the Greek aspirate in the middle of the word.
'745 Altitonans here must mean merely lond-roaring though applied to
Jupiter by Cicero and Ennius it signifies thundering on high 3 and this
is the usual force in altivolans altisonus and the like. '746 bruma
may be used here in its proper sense of the shortest day, after which
the severest cold usually follows, and winter may be said to come in
earnest. 749 certo tempore, every day, that is : see n. to 704.
751—770: solar eclipses may be caused by the moon intercepting
the rays, as the astronomers say 3 but some opaque and invisible body
may just as well be the cause: or the sun may lose for the time his
own light-..in passing through spots inimical to it: lunar eclipses may
similarly be explained, mutatis mutandis3 thus in the first case it will
be the earth which keeps from it the sun's mys—The three theories
here offered to explain the eclipses of the sun and moon are quite pa-
